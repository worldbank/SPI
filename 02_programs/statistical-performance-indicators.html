<p>Each dimension of the five pillars incorporates several indicators. These Statistical Performance Indicators embody the granular measures of performance. They can be aggregated to levels of dimensions and pillars, and finally to an overall performance score to get a higher level or a more general perspective of a country’s performance.</p>
<p>The indicators are designed to act as proxy measures of performance for each dimension. While not comprehensive, they should add value in assessing country performance along that dimension. The intention is for the pillars and dimensions to be the focus rather than the specific indicators.
The indicators for the SPI are selected following these principles: (i) use of publicly accessible data; (ii) transparent methodology; (iii) easy replicability; (iv) a time series to track performance; (v) clear portrayal of outcomes and their supporting elements; (vi) being reflective of the SDGs; (vii) enable at-a-glance comparisons on a global scale.</p>
<p>Benefitting from large scale data collection efforts by organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, Open Data Watch, PARIS21, the ILO, WHO, UNESCO, IHSN, and the UN, among others, 51 indicators covering 14 out of the 22 dimensions for the dashboard have been compiled. These 51 indicators provide data for each of the five pillars on data use, data services, data products, data sources, and data infrastructure. Yet, there remain major gaps in several pillars because indicators to assess performance still need to be developed, and in some cases, indicators have limited data coverage. This data availability challenge impedes efforts to measure the performance of statistical systems in certain areas and going forward countries and their international partners must work together to fill these gaps.</p>
<p>Below is a brief description of the indicators (or lack thereof) we have available for the 22 dimensions in the SPI framework. A detailed description of the indicators is also available in the annex. For as many as eight dimensions there was no indicator with a developed methodology, or the data collection for that measure was incomplete.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 1.1: Data use by national legislature:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology. In principle it may be possible to utilize websites of national legislatures but this will require further work and assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 1.2: Data use by national executive branch:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology. There are some usable data sources (as used by <span class="citation">(PARIS21 2019)</span>) but gaps in data across countries have prevented full adoption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 1.3: Data use by civil society:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology. There are some usable data sources with good coverage, for example from social media but more data is required to help assess and allow for likely biases between and within countries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 1.4: Data use by academia:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology. We have not been able to find usable data sources with global coverage on which a new methodology could be developed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 1.5: Data use by international organizations:</strong> Five measures of usefulness or reliability of country produced measures for international organizations have been included. First, on comparability of poverty estimates for the World Bank reporting on international poverty using <a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet">Povcalnet</a> (<span class="citation">(Castaneda Aguilar et al. 2020)</span>). Second on usable surveys for statistics on child mortality for the <a href="https://childmortality.org/">UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation</a> (<span class="citation">(Child Mortality Estimation (UNIGME) 2020)</span>). Third on accuracy of debt reporting as classified by the World Bank (Source: World Bank WDI metadata). Fourth, on availability of safely managed drinking water data for use by <a href="https://washdata.org/">WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme</a> (<span class="citation">(Programme 2018)</span>). Fifth, on labor force participation data for use by <a href="https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf">ILO</a>. While these data sources provide only a partial coverag of data used by international organizations, they do provide an indication of the performance of the national statistical system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 2.1: Data Releases:</strong> SDDS/e-GDDS subscription. This indicator is based on whether the country subscribes to IMF SDDS+, SDDS, or e-GDDS standards. The source is the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. This is a reliable data source but we recognize that it is a proxy for the concept we are seeking to capture rather than a direct measurement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 2.2: Online access:</strong> ODIN Open Data Openness score (Crowell et al). This is a well-established data source with good country coverage, which scores countries based on whether indicators are available online in a format that is machine readable, in a non-proprietary format, downloadable, with metadata available and terms of use. Scores range from 0-1. For more details, consult the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBK0hN6MoQrii7_E1bmRXmsUcE8Fbb-Q32nxm8d8qTw/edit">ODIN technical documentation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 2.3: Advisory/ Analytical Services:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology. This could be a new indicator of the number of non-recurring products on NSO website (ad hoc/experimental rather than regular releases). The indicator is the number of products found. No established source exists for this indicator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 2.4: Data access services:</strong> NADA metadata. This indicator checks whether NADA microdata cataloging is available for surveys produced by NSO. NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Cores RDF metadata standards. Source: NSO websites.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 3.1: Social Statistics:</strong> Availability of indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals 1-6, measured by an average score. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. While this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, many countries are not yet submitting all their available national data. For this reason, scores for some countries thus may not fully capture their performance in calculating the indicators. For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in M<a href="https://www.oecd.org/sdd/measuring-distance-to-the-sdg-targets-2019-a8caf3fa-en.htm">Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 3.2: Economic Statistics:</strong> Availability of Goal 7-12 indicators, measured by an average score. See 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 3.3: Environmental Statistics:</strong> Availability of Goal 13 &amp; 15 indicators, measured by an average score. Goal 14 - Life on Water - is not included because land-locked countries do not report on these indicators. See 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 3.4: Institutional Statistics:</strong> Availability of Goal 16-17 indicators measured by an average score. See 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 4.1: Censuses and Surveys:</strong> Availability of recent censuses and surveys covering broad areas. The following censuses and surveys are considered: Population &amp; Housing census, Agriculture census, Business/establishment census, Household Survey on income/ consumption/ expenditure/ budget/ Integrated Survey, Agriculture survey, Labor Force Survey, Health/Demographic survey, Business/establishment survey. Source: NSO websites, World Bank microdata library, ILO microdata library, IHSN microdata library.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 4.2: Administrative Data:</strong> Availability of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) indicator. An ideal indicator for this dimension would include a score based on the density of administrative data available in sectors including social protection, education, labor, and health. However, social protection, education, health, and labor admin data indicators are not included because of lack of established methodology. While several promising sources for administrative data from the World Bank’s ASPIRE team, WHO, UNESCO, and ILO have been identified, these were not included due to incomplete coverage across countries. Further research and data collection effort would be needed to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of administrative data availability can be produced.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 4.3: Geospatial Data:</strong> Geospatial data available at 1st Admin Level. This data source from Open Data Watch focuses on data availability at the sub-national level and provides a partial understanding of a country’s ability to produce geospatial data. A research and data collection effort is needed to develop a more comprehensive global database of the availability of key geospatial indicators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 4.4: Private/citizen generated data:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology. Currently no comprehensive source exists to measure the use of private and citizen generated data in national statistical systems, and this should be another area where more data collection is needed by the international community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 5.1: Legislation and governance:</strong> This indicator is based on PARIS21 indicators on SDG 17.18.2 (national statistical legislation compliance with UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics), existence of National Statistical Council, national statistical strategy generation, national statistical plan. Limited country coverage makes cross country comparison limited. As a result, this is included in the dashboard, but not in the overall SPI score or index.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 5.2: Standards and Methods:</strong> This set of indicators is based on countries’ use of internationally accepted and recommended methodologies, classifications and standards regarding data integration. These indicators help facilitate data exchange and provide the foundation for the preparation of relevant statistical indicators. The following methods and standards are considered: System of national accounts in use, National Accounts base year, Classification of national industry, CPI base year, Classification of household consumption, Classification of status of employment, Central government accounting status, Compilation of government finance statistics, Compilation of monetary and financial statistics, Business process. Further work could improve the validity of this indicator and reduce the risk that countries may be incentivized to adopt only traditional standards and methods and neglect innovative solutions that may be more valid in the current context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 5.3: Skills:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology or suitable data sources. A new indicator drawing on PARIS21 indicators such as statistical society presence and data literacy could be developed and is an area of future work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 5.4: Partnerships:</strong> Not included because of lack of established methodology or suitable data sources. A new indicator based on textual analysis of NSS reports/websites for references to partner organizations could be developed. This is an area of future work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension 5.5: Finance:</strong> The indicator is based on PARIS21 SDG indicators (SDG 17.18.3 (national statistical plan that is fully funded and under implementation). It is included in dashboard, but not in the overall SPI score or index because of insufficient country coverage. For more details: <span class="citation">(Yu Tian 2020)</span>.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Data gaps<a href="statistical-performance-indicators.html#data-gaps" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The approach taken to the development of the SPI has been to start with a <em>first</em> best framework and then try and find suitable indicators to help measure progress against that framework. This has revealed a significant number of data gaps. In many critical areas of national statistical system performance, at present there is no available data to construct measures. This calls for a substantial research agenda, requiring a wide range of countries, international agencies and other organizations to work together to produce globally comparable, comprehensive, consistent and transparent information about national statistical systems.</p>
<p>An area of particular concern is the pillar of data use. Currently, the dashboard only features indicators for one of the five dimensions of data use, which is data use by international organizations. Indicators on whether statistical systems are providing useful data to their national governments (legislature and executive branches), to civil society, and to academia are absent. Thus the dashboard does not yet assess if national statistical systems are meeting the data needs of a large swathe of users.</p>
<p>Under the pillar of data services an area that needs improvement is the measurement of advisory and analytical services provided by NSOs, such as data stewardship services. By measuring this type of work done by NSOs that goes beyond producing data, the international community and the NSOs themselves can better assess whether this type of support is in place.</p>
<p>In the data sources pillar, more information is needed in the areas of administrative data, geospatial data, and private and citizen generated data. On administrative data, the picture is incomplete with no measures of whether countries have administrative data systems in place to measure health, education, labor, and social protection program statistics. For the geospatial indicator, there is a proxy measure of whether the country is able to produce indicators at the sub-national level, but as yet, no understanding of how countries are using geospatial information in other ways, for instance using satellite data. And while the world is increasingly awash with private and citizen generated data (e.g., on mobility, job search, or social networking), on a global scale there is no reliable source to measure how national statistical systems are incorporating this information.</p>
<p>Finally, several of the ‘soft’ components of the data infrastructure pillar lack adequate data. This includes the areas of skills and of partnerships between entities in the national statistical system. The dashboard makes use of the PARIS21 led SDG indicator on whether the statistical legislations in countries met the standards of the UN Fundamental Principles of Statistics, but this was not incorporated into the overall SPI score, because of inadequate country coverage. This is also true of the PARIS21 led SDG indicator on whether the national statistical system is fully funded. Countries would need to be encouraged to report on this information.</p>

<p>The SPI draws on a variety of data sources to create the indicators. A guiding principle is that the SPI rely on openly available data from credible sources, such as international organizations and NSO websites. The SPI team used web scraping, accessed publicly available databases, or in some cases visited NSO websites to acquire the information. While greater detail for each specific indicator can be found in the <a href="https://worldbank.github.io/SPI/">technical documentation</a> describing each indicator, a general overview is provided here.</p>
<p>For pillar 1 on data use, data is collected from four distinct sources. The World Bank supplies data for indicators on availability of comparable poverty data (from the World Bank’s <a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/introduction.aspx">Povcalnet</a> system), and the indicator on quality of debt service data (from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators or <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/home">WDI metadata</a>). Data on the availability of under 5 child mortality data comes from the <a href="https://childmortality.org/">UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation</a>. The indicator on availability of safely managed drinking water data is sourced from the <a href="https://washdata.org/">WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme</a>. The indicator on the availability of source data for measuring labor force participation comes from the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf">ILO</a>. Each of these sources will be updated annually prior to each annual data release. The date the data is updated for each of these sources is available in our technical documentation.</p>
<p>For pillar 2 on data services, information on data dissemination subscription is collected from the <a href="https://dsbb.imf.org/">IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board</a>. This and the WDI metadata follow the same update schedule and the release these two sources are identical. The online access indicator is sourced from the Open Data Watch ODIN openness score. The date of the data download is available in the technical description for this indicator. The indicator for data access services is based on (i) whether a portal is available, (ii) compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and with Dublin Core’s RDF metadata standards, and (iii) which has a listing of surveys and microdata sets that can provide the necessary data and reference for follow-up. This information is collected manually by visiting each NSO website.</p>
<p>For the data products dimension, indicators are generated using the UN Global SDG monitoring database. For each SDG indicator, the database is checked to see whether a value is available within a five year window. (for instance, for 2019 if a value is available between 2015-2019. For OECD countries, the UN SDG database is supplemented with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in <a href="https://www.oecd.org/sdd/measuring-distance-to-the-sdg-targets-2019-a8caf3fa-en.htm">Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand</a>. The decision to supplement the UN Global SDG monitoring database using this OECD database was taken, because a clear methodology had been established to do so. The UN Global SDG monitoring database was chosen as a primary source, rather than individual NSO websites, because data submitted to the UN Global SDG monitoring database goes through a standardized process including quality control and detailed documentation.</p>
<p>For dimension 4, on censuses and surveys, two complementary approaches are taken to collecting data. The first is to make use of data submitted to the World Bank, IHSN, ILO, and FAO microdata libraries. Only surveys that are marked as nationally representative are used, and surveys are classified (as either health surveys, agriculture surveys, labor force surveys, etc.) using the classifications submitted to the microdata libraries. The contents of searches on these databases are available in the github repository. The second approach is a manual data collection effort, where NSO websites have been visited to be sure no surveys were missed. To be included in this search, the survey or census must be publicly available and accessible. If surveys or censuses are missed in this search, the easiest way for a country to get it included would be to create an entry for the survey at one of the microdata libraries. Information on the completeness of the Civil Registry and Vital Statistics (CRVS) is sourced from the UN SDG global monitoring database. Information on whether data is available at the 1st administrative level, for the geospatial indicator, is sourced from Open Data Watch, as is the data openness score.</p>
<p>For dimension 5, data on the legislation indicator and finance indicators (compiled by PARIS21) are pulled from the UN SDG global monitoring database. Indicators in the standards and methods pillar are sourced primarily through the IMF. Information on the system of national accounts in use and national accounts base year are sourced through the World Bank’s WDI metadata. Data for the business process indicator is sourced through the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).
A full description of each specific indicator is available in Appendix A6 and in the SPI github repository.</p>
