Statistical Performance Indicators - Raw Data folder
================

This folder contains the raw data that will be used to form the Statistical Performance Indicators.  By raw data, we mainly mean data that has not yet been transformed into an indicator.  The data may have gone through an initial process of cleaning however.  For instance, with in the 4.1_SOCS folder you can find a database containing the last population censuses.
