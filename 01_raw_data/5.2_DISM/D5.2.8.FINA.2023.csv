3,3,4,AND,Andorra,,,ESA 2010,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The compilation of government finance statistics is carried out in accordance with the concepts of the General Budget Law. The compiled data are: ExpendituresRevenuesManagement, cash and fiscal year budget balancesPublic expenditure in the different classes of the COFOG division.  GFSM 2014 data are not yet compiled. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The scope is in line with internationally accepted standards. The GFS cover the entire central government sector and all budgetary balances and economic flows.  The state budget includes central government.  The data cover the entire territory of the Principality of Andorra.  The data presented in the GFS are not consolidated, they are aggregated.  All transactions extrabudgetary are not included.  Exceptions to coverage  All extrabudgetary transactions are not included.  Unrecorded activity  All extrabudgetary transactions are not included. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification of entities is in accordance with the General Budget Law. The classification of institutional sectors and subsectors is defined according to the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). Revenues and expenditures are classified according with internationally accepted standards.  The budget is classified into chapters, line items, concepts and sub-categories. The budget distinguishes between the main economic categories of current revenues and expenses and capital revenues and expenses. 2.4.1 Valuation  Taxes are classified according to their nature, direct (income taxes) or indirect (consumption taxes).  Non-tax revenues include taxes, services rendered, sale of goods and other revenues and property income. Capital revenues consist of the sale of real investments and capital transfers. Finally, income from financial assets and liabilities is included.  Expenditures are classified according to economic classification and distinguish between current and capital expenditures. Current expenses include personnel expenses, purchases of goods and services, interest payments, subsidies and current transfers. Capital expenditures include investments and capital transfers. Finally, expenses on financial assets and liabilities are included.  All the results are presented in market value.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Data are recorded on Accrual basis.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  All transactions are recorded on a net basis as long as the corrective transactions were made during the calendar year.",
4,4,5,AGO,Angola,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Statistics on budget execution are compiled and disseminated in accordance with the combined provisions of Law 9/97 of October 17, Framework Law on the General State Budget; yearly instructions for execution of the General State Budget; and Decree 73/01 of October 12 approving SIGFE (Integrated Government Financial Management System). The analytical table on state budget execution is generally consistent with the recommendations of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM). However, the following main differences exist in definitions at the highest level of aggregation: Total revenue includes current and capital revenue, defined as receipts that do not generate an obligation to repay, plus grants (donations), plus financing received (disbursements), defined as the increase in future commitments to pay; Total expenditure includes those expenditures, described as nonrefundable payments, defined in accordance with the GFSM, plus repayments (which reduce commitments), plus lending. Given that there is no decentralization of the budget, the operations imputed to local (provincial) governments are included in central government operations. In relation to social security and the autonomous agencies and funds, only transfers between the central government and these institutions are recorded, but their own revenue and expenditure are not included. Operations are essentially classified according to the 1986 GFSM classification system, with the following exceptions: loan repayments received, disbursements of financing, and revenue from the sale of assets are recorded as income, while lending, debt amortization, and the acquisition of assets are recorded as expenditure. However, these items are adjusted in compiling the fiscal balance, which divides revenue into tax revenue (by broad category of taxes) and nontax revenue; expenditure is classified as current and capital; financing includes grants and net domestic and external financing, divided on the basis of the residence of the creditor. Domestic financing is broken down into bank and nonbank financing, which latter also includes extraordinary income, such as the oil bonus, income from the sale of state assets, and net lending. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The National Accounting Directorate of the Ministry of Finance prepares monthly working balances and produces quarterly reports on general state budget execution. The data they reflect cover the cash operations of the central government and the provincial governments (18 provinces), but exclude the operations of social security and the autonomous agencies and funds. Central government includes the Office of the President of the Republic, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, the Audit Office, the ministries, the university, and any branches thereof. Fiscal year transactions must be closed by December 31. However, payment orders may be paid up to January 31 of the following year and posted to the year to which they correspond. According to the legislation in force, the closing of accounts and the annual report on budget execution are completed by April 15 of the each year. Consolidation is based on the recommendations of the GFSM.The data are published quarterly on the Ministry of Finance Web site and included in the reports on implementation of the government’s program 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification System The classification of the data on general state budget execution is as follows: Total revenue  Current revenue  - Tax revenue  Taxes  Taxes on income  Taxes on assets  Taxes on production  Taxes on consumption  Taxes on foreign trade  Other taxes  Rates  Contributions  Other tax revenue  - Asset revenue Income from real estate property  Income from equity  Income from financing  Income from natural resources  - Revenue services - Current transfer revenue  - Other current revenue  Capital revenue  - Sales of capital assets  - Income from financing  Income from capital transfers  Other capital income Total expenditure  Current expenditure  - Operating expenditure  Personnel expenditure  Employer contributions  Expenditure on goods and services  - Interest  Domestic  External  - Grants and current transfers  Grants  Current transfers  - Capital expenditure  Investment expenditure  Capital transfers  Financial capital expenditure  Investment in financial assets  Amortization of financial liabilities  Reserves For purposes of macroeconomic programming, the fiscal balance is also compiled and disseminated in a format that more closely resembles the analytical table recommended by the 1986 GFSM. In this table, revenue is divided into tax and nontax revenue; expenditure is classified as current and capital expenditure; financing includes grants and net external and domestic financing, broken down according to the criterion of residence of the creditor. Domestic financing is divided into bank and nonbank financing; the latter also includes extraordinary income, such as the oil bonus, income from the sale of state assets, and net lending. The composition of fiscal balance data is as follows: Revenue  Tax revenue  - Oil revenue  - Nonoil revenue  Tax on income  Tax on goods and services  Tax on foreign trade  Other  Nontax revenue Current expenditure  Personnel expenditure  Goods and services  Interest due  - Domestic  - External  Transfers Current balance (on an accrual basis) Capital expenditure Total expenditure  Overall balance (on an accrual basis)  Changes in the payment of arrears  - Domestic  - External interest  Overall balance (on a cash basis) Financing  Grants  External financing (net)  - Disbursements  - Amortization  Amortization due  Changes in arrears (decrease -)  - Short-term loans (net)  Domestic financing (net)  - Central bank  - Other  Debt relief 2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting data are recorded on a cash basis. To compile transactions on an accrual basis, nonaccounting data are used, in particular for changes in domestic and external arrears.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures",
5,5,6,ATG,Antigua and Barbuda,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The annual data on central government transactions are compiled in the Budget Office and disseminated in the ECCB ""Report and Statements of Accounts"". The analytical framework used is the economic classification as follows: Current Revenue Tax Revenue Non tax RevenueCurrent Expenditure Current Account Balance Capital Revenue Grants Capital Expenditure & Net Lending Overall Balance Financing Domestic ECCB (net) Commercial banks (net) Other (residual) External Net Amortisation Disbursements Amortisation Change in Govt. Foreign Assets Arrears Domestic External A similar framework is also published in the ""ECCB Statistical Digest"". Note that data on interest payments are already compiled and disseminated. The concepts used in compiling the annual data on central government revenue are broadly in line with those of the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986"" (""GFS Manual""). Revenue includes non-repayable receipts other than foreign grants. Expenditures include non-repayable outlays. All transactions that give rise to changes in the government's financial assets and liabilities are treated as financing, except for government loans for policy purposes that are treated above the line as net lending. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data cover the budget of the central government only. Data for Barbuda Council are published in the annual estimates of revenue and expenditure. Transfers to the Barbuda Council are included in the central government expenditures. Provisional monthly and quarterly data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and disseminated quarterly in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) ""Economic and Financial Review"", a quarterly publication showing the following data in millions of Eastern Caribbean dollars (EC$): current revenue, broken down into tax and nontax revenue; current expenditure, including interest payments; and current account balance. Annual data on the consolidated central government fiscal operations present a more complete classification including current revenue, current expenditure, current account balance, and, in addition, capital revenue, grants, capital expenditure and net lending, capital account balance, overall balance, and financing. Financing is equal to, and opposite in sign to, the overall deficit/surplus since amortization payments are included as negative financing in accordance with GFS recommendations. Financing data are broken down into domestic financing and foreign financing. Domestic financing is classified by debt holders (ECCB, commercial banks, and other), while foreign financing show net amortization (disbursement minus amortization) and the change in government foreign assets. Due to the errors and omissions in the recording of financing data, the overall deficit/surplus does not equal total financing, with an opposite sign. As a result, the published data include a residual, which is calculated as the difference between the recorded overall deficit/surplus and the recorded total financing. Data on the encouraged component of interest payments are disseminated on a quarterly basis in the ECCB ""Economic and Financial Review"", and on an annual basis in the ""Annual Economic and Social Review"" published by the MOF and in the ECCB's ""Annual Statistical Digest"" and ""Report and Statement of Accounts"". Interest payments are broken down into those on foreign loans and those on domestic debt. Quarterly data are on a cash basis and are compiled from the actual accounting records of the central government. Annual data are compiled using the same source data as the quarterly data, but using more complete and consolidated presentations. The fiscal year of the government is April 1 to March 31. Data disseminated for the current fiscal year are preliminary estimates, and those for the previous fiscal year are revised estimates. Data become final actual after 2 years.  Exceptions to coverage  There are significant extra budgetary functions carried out by Medical Benefits Scheme, Board of Education, and Transport Board, but the operations of these units and Social Security Scheme are not included. However, these entities publish their own annual statement of accounts. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Detailed data for the analytical framework set out above are available as follows: (1) tax revenue classified by type; (2) nontax revenue classified by type; (3) current expenditures by economic classification; (4) capital expenditures by economic classification; (5) lending minus repayments; (6) current and capital transfers to public enterprises according to economic classification and (7) a breakdown of financing into foreign and domestic with domestic financing further broken down into the banking and nonbanking sectors. The residual results from net errors and omissions in the recording of financing data, and is calculated as the difference between the recorded overall deficit/surplus and the recorded total financing. Data for the current fiscal year are preliminary actuals and those of the previous year are revised actuals. Data for earlier years are final actuals. Quarterly data on central government operations that include current revenue with details of tax revenues, current expenditure with an economic classification, and the current account balance are compiled and disseminated in the ECCB quarterly ""Economic and Financial Review"". 2.4.1 Valuation  Payments and receipts in foreign currency, such as amortization payments and loan proceeds, are converted into local EC dollars using the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Annual data for central government transactions are recorded on a cash basis. Expenditures are recorded on a cash-paid and checks-issued basis. Revenue is recorded when cash or credit advices from government departments are paid into the Treasury. Quarterly data for central government expenditure is recorded on an accrual (commitment) basis. These are disseminated in the ECCB quarterly ""Economic and Financial Review.""",

7,7,8,ARM,Armenia,2001,2001,2001,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical framework: The definition of the government sector applied in the government finance statistics is consistent with the definition set out in the ""2008 System of National Accounts"" (SNA 2008). The methodology for compiling government finance statistics is broadly consistent with the analytical framework set out in the IMF's A Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM) 2001. The budget deficit/surplus is defined as total revenue minus total expenditure and operations in non-financial transactions. A budget deficit is reflected with a ""minus"" sign, and a budget surplus is reflected with a ""plus"" sign. Financing is defined as the amount of total borrowing less repayment of debt principal and net lending. For budgetary and GFS purposes, the central government is also referred in the national definition as state government. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Institutional coverage of central government in reported data: The central government includes all units of government that exercise authority over the entire economic territory of Armenia. The 10 regions (Marz) have no budgetary autonomy and their operations are included in the central government data. The data of extrabudgetary funds are also reported as central government operations.  Exceptions to coverage  Monthly data do not include disbursements and spending of external transfers by the project implementation units (PIU), which however are included in the quarterly and annual data. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The data are compiled and disseminated in the following statistical framework: Revenue Total revenue and grants Revenue Tax Revenue Other Revenues Social Insurance Payments Official Transfers (Grants) Received\ Expenditure and Operations in non-financial transactions\ Current Expenditure Non-financial transactions Expenditures related to non-financial assets Sales of non-financial assets Budget Deficit (Surplus) Financing of Deficit (Use of Surplus) of Budget Domestic External Detailed data on central government revenue are available as follows: (1) tax revenue classified by types of taxes, fees, and other mandatory charges; (2) other revenue classified by types of revenue, including revenue from fines and sanctions; (3) social insurance payments, (4) official transfers (grants) received, classified by cash and in kind, and by sources. Detailed data on central government expenditure are available as follows: (1) current expenditure classified by economic type, including interest (broken down by domestic and foreign), and by function; (2) expenditures related to non-financial assets classified by function; and (3) sales of non-financial assets classified by function. Financing data are classified as domestic and external, and domestic credit is broken down by type of creditor (banking and non-banking system) and by type of debt instrument. Proceeds from privatization are classified as non-bank domestic financing. Data on external financing are disaggregated by disbursements and principal repayments. Classification System and relationship with international guidelines: The classification system used in the government finance statistics is broadly consistent with the GFSM. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: All transactions are valued at current prices on the date at which they are recorded. Transactions expressed in foreign currency are basically converted to local currency using the exchange rate fixed in the Budget Message. Grants in kind are valued when they are monetized.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: All government operations are recorded on a cash basis, through the Unified Treasury Account (UTA). Expenditures are recorded when the UTA is debited and revenues are recorded when the UTA is credited. Grants in kind are included in the government operations statistics as monetization proceeds are credited to the UTA. Complementary period: Prior to 2000 there was an accounting period during which expenditures approved under the previous budget could be settled and recorded in the accounts of the respective fiscal year. The duration of the complementary period was through January 31 of the following year. Starting in 2000 year the complementary period has been eliminated.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustments for grossing and netting transactions: Data are recorded on a gross basis. Revenue and expenditure refunds are treated as corrective transactions and are netted out from the respective revenue or expenditure category, as appropriate. Taxes paid by government units are included in expenditure data of the respective unit and are classified as revenue by type of taxes paid.",
8,8,9,AUS,Australia,2014,2014,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical Framework and Concepts: Under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, the Australian Government is required to produce periodic financial reports using external reporting standards and any departure from these standards are to be disclosed. The two major standards used in reporting are AAS and ABS GFS based on IMF GFSM. The Australian Government produces financial statements in accordance with AASB1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting. This standard aims to harmonise GFS and AAS in a single set of financial statements. A single set of financial statement, adopting GFS treatment except where AAS provide a better conceptual treatment, was produced for the first time in the 2008-09 Budget. Detailed statements are produced including an Income statement (where other economic flows are also reported), balance sheet, and cash flow statements. Monthly data is compiled under the terms of the PGPA Act 2013, Section 47. Monthly transactions are recorded by agencies on an accrual AAS basis and consolidated into a single set of GFS based general government income statement, balance sheet , and cash flow statements. From July 2008, to be consistent with the 2008-09 Budget, the monthly Financial Statements were presented in the format as prescribed under AASB 1049. From the 2008-09 financial year, the CFS, which provides financial data on the total Australian government and its component sectors, are also produced based on AASB1049. Relationship with international guidelines: Major fiscal aggregates are based on GFSM: Fiscal balance - conceptually equivalent to GFSM net lending Underlying cash balance - conceptually equivalent to GFSM cash deficit/surplus less net cash income from Future Fund, which commenced operations in 2006. This adjustment ceased in 2019-20 as the Fund can be used to finance pension benefits. Net worth, net financial worth and net debt are released monthly. Net worth is conceptually equivalent to GFSM net worth, however, as acknowledged in Budget and related documentation, it includes provisions for bad and doubtful debts to avoid overstatement of the value of financial assets. Also, other known material conceptual differences are acknowledged in published estimates and annual actual documentation as required under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. Net debt covers interest bearing liabilities and selected financial assets. It does not include all instruments designated as debt in the IMF GFS 2014 manual. The new Australian Accounting Standard, AASB 16 Leases, applied to all Australian Government entities from 1 July 2019. AASB 16 introduced a single lease accounting framework for lessees and removed the distinction between operating and finance leases (consistent with IFRS). As a result, new assets and liabilities have been recognised on the balance sheet for leases that were previously accounted for as operating expenses. The reduction in operating lease expenses is replaced with the depreciation charge for the right of use assets and interest expense on the lease liabilities. Fiscal balance is impacted by the recognition of non-financial assets under lease. The implementation of AASB 16 has implications for a number of budget aggregates, in particular, net debt and net financial worth due to the recognition of the new lease liabilities. To maintain consistency in the measurement of the underlying cash balance, the principal payments on lease liabilities which are recognised as cash flows from financing activities, have been included in the calculation following the implementation of AASB 16. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Institutional coverage of central government in reported data: Central government operations cover the financial activities of the central general government sector, including its financial relations with state and local governments. It excludes the operations of corporations controlled by the central government that operate within the trading and financial enterprise sectors, but includes subsidies and grants paid to and dividend income received from these corporations. All GGS entities are required to report monthly on their own operations and those conducted on behalf of government. A listing of all GGS entities is published in a note of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see link below): http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/commonwealth-consolidated-financial-statements/  Exceptions to coverage  The data does not include the operations of the central government commercial activities but includes subsidies and grants paid to and dividend income received from these corporations. There are no social security schemes in Australia (social insurance schemes operated by government that cover the entire or large sections of the community), as described in IMF GFS manual Appendix 2 Social Protection.  Unrecorded activity  All financial transactions of the Australian GGS are covered. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Income is separated into revenue and gains, with revenue split into taxation and non-taxation components. Taxation revenue is generally recognised when the economic event giving rise to the taxpayer's liability occurs. However, for some taxes such as individuals, company and superannuation revenue, such an estimation method is unreliable and tax revenue is recognised the earlier of when an assessment of tax liability is made or when cash payment is received by the Australian Taxation Office. Accordingly, for these categories of taxation revenue, there is a short time lag between when revenue is recognised and when the underlying economic activity occurred. Major economic categories of expenses such as purchases of goods and services, grants, subsidies and interest are published. The revised version of the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is currently not used. However, there is sufficient detail to convert the 14 major categories to the 10 major functional categories used in the revised COFOG as required. Assets are disaggregated into financial and non-financial components and interest bearing debt is clearly distinguished within liabilities. Cash flows are separated into operating, investing and financing categories. 2.4.1 Valuation  Foreign exchange transactions are reported using the spot rate unless the exchange rate is fixed under contract, consistent with AAS. Any foreign exchange gain or loss is removed for reporting of fiscal balance (net lending/borrowing) and treated as other economic flows. Under IFRS, assets and liabilities are generally recorded on a fair value basis consistent with GFSM market valuation basis.  2.4.2 Recording basis  All financial data is produced on a full accrual basis consistent with AAS. Published data is based on GFSM derived from accounting data subject to departures where AAS provides a better conceptual treatment. Cash flow statement data is derived for the general government sector and is therefore only available after the provision of agency income statements and balance sheets. The period of reporting is a calendar month within a July to June financial year.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Under the AAS and GFS standards, there are only limited opportunities for the netting of data. The following are the main areas where netting is permitted: Refunds of taxation and tax credits that are an integral part of the taxation system. Correction of erroneous or unauthorised transactions expense transactions. Stocks and flows where the government has the legal ability to settle on a net basis.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Annual data presented in the annual report of the Central Treasury (""Implementation of the Government Budget"") are compiled following the national ""Classification of Government Revenue and Expenditures"" that is compatible with the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" (""GFSM""). The data broadly follow the following classification: Revenue, including tax and non-tax revenue, capital revenue and grants (with a breakdown by types of taxes and revenue). Total expenditure data, including credits, are compiled with a breakdown by functional and economic classification. Deficit/surplus and financing by foreign and domestic sources are shown with a breakdown by types of instruments. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data are also collected on the social security program (the Social Fund) but not included in the budget statistics. Grants in kind (predominantly food imports) are not included in the data on central government operations. The data cover budgetary organizations. Consolidated data are compiled for government authorities as a whole, including data on operations of local authorities. Data on the operations of extra-budgetary units are compiled but not included in the budget statistics.  Exceptions to coverage  Only budgetary institutions (organizations) are covered in the data with the exclusion of extra-budgetary funds of the central government (for example, the Social Fund). However, transfers made by the government to the Social Fund are identified in the budget report, as are grants to local government authorities. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Annual data presented in the annual report of the Central Treasury (""Implementation of the Government Budget"") are compiled following the national ""Classification of Government Revenue and Expenditures"" that is compatible with the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" (""GFSM""). Accordingly, six classifications of government operations are used: classification structure of operations by revenue; classification of functions of government; economic classification of government expenditure and loans less repayments; administrative classification; classification structure of operations related to financing (by type of debt instrument); classification structure of operations related to financing (by type of creditor-debt holder). 2.4.1 Valuation  All valuation is in manats. Accordingly, transactions denominated in foreign currency are converted into the local currency at the prevailing exchange rate.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Recording method. Expenditures are recorded on the basis of cash paid out and checks issued. Revenue is recorded on a cash basis (checks and cash received). Time of recording.

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The methodology for compiling government finance statistics is consistent with the analytical framework set out in the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM) 1986"". Concepts, definitions, and classification systems used in compiling these data follow in general the corresponding provisions of the GFSM. The Post Office, Port and Aviation departments are treated as non-financial public enterprises (a different treatment to that found in the government’s audited accounts). Whenever revenues exceed expenditures, the surplus is included under the revenue category ‘Income: Public Enterprises’. On the other hand, deficits are included in the capital expenditure category as: ‘Capital Transfers to Non-financial Public Enterprises’. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Refunds in respect of Incentive Acts & Other Refunds are excluded from Tax Revenue.  The entire country is covered.  The data cover the budgetary position of Central Government only, comprising the following units: audit, cabinet, governorate, house of assembly, judiciary, ministries, senate, and service commissions. The operations of the Social Security Scheme, and the National Insurance Board, are not included.  Exceptions to coverage  Social security accounts are excluded. Unrecorded activity  Not applicable. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The following classification is used: Revenue, with a breakdown by (i) type of tax revenue (property, services, business & professional, motor vehicle, departure, international trade and transactions); and (ii) non-tax revenue (including income, fines, forfeits and administrative fees, sale of Government Property, other and grants).

13,13,14,BGD,Bangladesh,,2014,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The data are presented in a number of formats, one of which is Statement X titled ""Summary of Financing"". It presents the data in an analytical framework similar to that recommended in the IMF’s ""A Manual of Government Finance Statistics"" (GFSM). The framework used in the ""Summary of Financing"" is as follows: Revenue Receipts of the Consolidated Fund minus Expenditure from the Consolidated Fund equals overall surplus/deficit. Deficit is financed by foreign financing and domestic financing. Concepts and Definitions: The concepts and definitions broadly follow those of the GFSM with the following exceptions: i). Foreign grants are treated as a deficit financing item. ii).The losses of certain nonfinancial public enterprises (NFPEs) such as Railways and Post Office are treated as negative revenue rather than expenditure. The profits of the Telegraph and Telephone Board are, however, treated as non-tax revenue, which is in accordance with the GFSM methodology. iii) Part of Lending minus Repayments (loans and Advances, net, which are net loans and advances to civil servants, autonomous bodies and sector corporations) are treated as part of capital expenditure. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The data cover the budgetary and accounting operations of the central government and profits and losses of public enterprises such as the Railways, the Post Office, and the Telephone and Telegraph (T amp;T). However, in line with the methodology recommended in the GFSM, day-to-day transactions of these organizations are excluded. These data are, however, available separately. The data cover all budgetary government units, including ministries, departments and their subordinate agencies. The data comprise revenue receipts, expenditure, overall deficit, and financing broken down into foreign and domestic financing. Both domestic and foreign financing are classified by type of debt instrument and type of debt holder. Revenue is broken down into tax and non-tax revenue. Expenditure includes both non-development expenditure (recurrent expenditure plus capital expenditure) and development expenditure. Capital expenditure includes loans and advances granted to various autonomous bodies, corporations and public servants as well as investments in the form of share and equity. Statement V titled ""Domestic Loans and Advances and Capital Investment"" shows the net inlay from the receipts from domestic borrowing and repayments of loans after deducting fresh loans and advances made during the fiscal year. Development expenditures include both ADP and non-ADP financing. Foreign financing is shown separately in the Statement IV titled ""Foreign Grants and Loans"". Impact of transactions in food operations into the budgetary framework are separately shown in Statement VII titled ""Summary of Food Budget"". The transactions on which the data are based, are recorded on a cash basis. The fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Finance Accounts contain actual amounts of receipts and expenditures while Appropriation Accounts contain actual amounts of expenditure by function and economic type vis-à-vis amount of allocation. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Revenue: It is classified into taxes and non-taxes, using definitions which appear to be broadly consistent with the GFSM methodology. More detailed data are presented in Statement I titled ""Broad Details of Revenue Receipts"". Expenditure: It is classified in separate statements by both function and economic type. The functional classification, used for revenue (recurrent) expenditure does not follow the international Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG), but is presented in sufficient detail to permit the data to be easily reclassified into the 14 categories of the COFOG system. This classification is set out in Statement II titled Broad Details of Revenue Expenditure. The Annual Development Program Expenditures are converted into budgetary format set out in Statement IX titled ""Development Expenditure by Ministry Division"" which is in line with the classification used for revenue expenditure. The development expenditure classifications are detailed enough to permit classification according to COFOG system. Capital expenditures (non-recurring loans and advances to public institutions and public servants, and equity investment) are separately shown in Statement V titled ""Domestic Loans and Advances, and Capital Investment"". Capital expenditure and recurrent expenditure together form the basis of non-development expenditure. Capital expenditures on programmes such as non-ADP projects (which do not form part of Statement V) are not classified by function. However, it represents relatively a small portion of total capital expenditure. The economic classification of revenue expenditure follows a format similar to that of the GFSM. These data are set out in Statement III titled ""Economic Analysis of Revenue Expenditure"" (excluding loans and food account operations). Capital expenditure as well as lending minus repayments are not classified by economic type. Financing: The classification system used for foreign financing is different from that used for domestic financing. Foreign financing is classified by debt instrument (grants and loans), further broken down into borrowing purpose (food aid, commodity aid, project aid, etc.). Term loans (bonds of different maturity), savings certificates and floating loans (treasury bills) comprise domestic financing. The GFSM classification is not used in classifying domestic financing. Annual time series data for the past 27 fiscal years, as well as monthly data for the current fiscal year, are published for selected tax revenue items in the monthly Bangladesh Bank bulletin ""Economic Trends"", with a lag of approximately 3 months. These data are based on the records of the National Board of Revenue (NBR), rather than the accounting records of the Controller-General of Accounts (CGA). Data on revenue receipts (taxes as well as some non-tax receipts and the revenue of the Post Office) for the past 5 fiscal years as well as monthly data for the past 12 calendar months are published in the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) monthly bulletin ""Statistical Bulletin, Bangladesh"", with a lag of approximately 5 months. As noted above, these data are based on the records of the NBR, the Ministry of Land, Forest Department, and the Post Office. However, the Appropriation Accounts and Finance Accounts which are based on the accounting records of the CGA are published with a time lag of approximately 1 year. With the introduction of new budgetary and accounts classification, CGA office is now able to publish Monthly Accounts data with a time lag of about 6 weeks. Presently, these data are being used by the Finance Division for internal use only. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Data on central government operations are recorded on a cash basis.",file:///C:/Users/wb469649/Downloads/1BGDEA2022001.pdf

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Central government transactions data are organized for analytical purposes using the system of definitions and classification used by the Treasury (Federal Public Service Finance). At an aggregated level, it fits the definition and classification presented in the Government Finance Statistical Manual (GFSM), IMF, 2001, except for the treatment of social security, which is excluded from the coverage of central government operations. More than 95 percent of revenue and expenditure of the central government are captured by the data on budgetary operations, according to the national accounts. The remaining part is explained by reconciliation of the data with the national accounts based on the ESA2010 methodology. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The central government units relate exclusively to the federal government and not to the state government (i.e., the communities and regions), the local government (i.e., the provinces, towns and municipalities), and the social security funds. The statistics cover the central government Treasury operations (Federal State). They refer to budgetary operations (revenue and expenditure) on a gross basis and other operations, and so called ""Treasury Operations"" (non-budgetary operations), on a net basis.  Budgetary revenues cover the revenues  recorded on a cash basis in respect of Ways and Means in the government  budget of the central government. These represent the total of receipt  collected, excluding revenues which are transferred to the state  government (i.e., the communities and the regions), to the local  government (i.e., the provinces, the towns and the municipalities), to the  social security funds and to the European Union, as they are collected by  the central government on behalf of these third parties. They are broken  down by federal public services and departments.  The budgetary expenditures include  transfers to the social security administration and social expenditures  directly paid by the central government to households (e.g., pensions and  family allowances to state employees, benefits to disabled persons, etc.).  Expenditures are broken down by unit (social unit, economic unit,  authority-department unit), within which the Federal Public Services and  departments are distributed. These expenditures include transfers to the  social security administration and social expenditures paid directly by  the central government to households (e.g., pensions and family allowances  to state employees, benefits to disabled persons, etc.).  Non-budgetary operations concern mainly  the outcome of debt management and operations in which the central  government acts as an intermediary (for instance, the collection of  revenues on behalf of the state or the local governments and the  operations with the European Union). As these means are not the ownership  of the central government, the non-budgetary operations are only presented  on a net basis (see summary of methodology). The budgetary revenue less the budgetary expenditure gives the budgetary balance to which the balance of non-budgetary operations is added to obtain the central government's net unfunded balance (deficit/surplus). The financing transactions correspond to the Federal Public Services Finance's changes in the Federal State debt statement, and are consistent with the monthly Treasury's Official debt statement (Debt of Federal State). 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Central government transactions data are organized for analytical purposes using the system of definitions and classification used by the Treasury (Federal Public Service Finance) cf. 2.1.1 Concepts and definition.Fiscal revenues are classified according to whether they are collected by the Direct Tax Authority (income tax deducted at source, advance payments, tax rolls of companies and natural persons, withholding tax on income from movable assets, road taxes, withholding tax on income from immovable assets, betting tax and tax on entertainment equipment), by the Customs and Excise Authority (customs and excise duties, opening of business and trading license fee, energy contribution, control fee for heating gas oil and eco-taxes) or by the Value Added Tax (VAT), Registration and Domain Authority (registration fees, VAT, fees of clerks of courts of law, mortgages, tax on non-profit associations and tax on coordination centers). 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into domestic currency at the prevailing market rates.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Central government transactions are recorded on a cash basis.",

The data are produced, checked, and disseminated by the Technical Secretariat of the National Committee for Monitoring Implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program (CNSAPAS), and the Directorate General of Economic Affairs. The concepts and definitions largely conform to the statistical framework defined by the 1986 edition of the IMF's ""Government Finance Statistics Manual"". The presentation of revenue and expenditure is designed to reflect sovereign expenditure, identify budgetary savings, calculate the budget deficit, and point out the resources for covering that deficit in terms of both domestic and external financing. In the statistical framework of Benin: (1) Revenue includes non-pledged central government receipts, broken down into tax and nontax revenue. It does not include grants. (2) Expenditure includes nonfinancial government obligations and financial operations by the government for general policy purposes. They are classified by type. This classification follows the nomenclature and budgetary classification of the organic statute governing the budget laws of Benin and reflects primary expenditure (including budgetary allocations to investment), capital expenditure (including mainly investment with foreign financing), interest (on the domestic and external debt), and net lending. (3) Financing represents those financial operations executed for liquidity purposes. This financing may be external (grants, loans, project financing) or domestic (bank, nonbank, and asset sales). Data are compiled on a payment order basis and prepared by the Budget Directorate. The information received from the Treasury is used to ensure consistency by means of cross-checks, with a view to monitoring budget execution in real terms. For legislative purposes, they are taken into account on a commitments basis. The data are compiled on a monthly and annual basis. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage The transactions of the aforementioned units throughout the national territory are taken into account.

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The fiscal statistics report the operations of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), which comprises general government and public enterprises. Although NFPS statistics are prepared in accordance with the methodology of the IMF's A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986 (GFS Manual), the presentation and classification are not totally consistent with the GFS Manual classifications, as indicated below. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  1. Above-the-line data The UPF records all operations for 153 institutions in the NFPS, which comprises general government and public enterprises. General government includes: (i) central government (National Treasury-TGN); (ii) local governments with nine departmental prefectures and 111 of the 314 town councils (10 departmental and 101 provincial capitals), representing approximately 75 percent of all municipalities; (iii) social security institutions; and (iv) other decentralized agencies. The largest public enterprises are the water supply companies, while the others are the remains of capitalized enterprises (capitalization process involving the sale of shares—up to 50 percent of the enterprise—to the private sector). The fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. 2. Below-the-line data The data cover the consolidated operations of the NFPS, which includes general government and public enterprises. The data are expressed in millions of units of local currency. The fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  1. Above-the-line data The data are classified in accordance with the following statistical framework: Total Revenue Current revenue Tax Nontax Transfers to social security (from the private sector) Other Capital revenue Grants Total Expenditure Current expenditure Personal services Goods and services Interest on domestic and external debt Other Capital expenditure Current (Deficit) or Surplus before Pensions Overall (Deficit) or Surplus before Pensions Pensions Current (Deficit) or Surplus after Pensions Overall (Deficit) or Surplus after Pensions Financing External financing Domestic financing 2. Below-the-line data The BCB publishes above-the-line and below-the-line data in the Annual Report, monthly data in the Monthly Bulletin, and quarterly data in the Statistical Bulletin. The Statistical Bulletin also includes annual data on fiscal years prior to the date of processing of the corresponding publication. Total financing is broken down into domestic and external based on the residence criterion and presented in accordance with the following statistical framework. Transfers and amortization in respect of international development agencies, foreign governments, and other external loans (from suppliers, for example) are recorded under external financing. Domestic financing includes financing from the monetary authority (BCB) and deposit money banks and other domestic financing, in particular from other financial institutions, from nonfinancial public enterprises, from the nonfinancial private sector, etc. (domestic financing). Total Financing External Financing Disbursements  Amortization  External debt relief – HIPC Initiative Bank Deposits Abroad Domestic Financing Central Bank Net financial system credit Other domestic financing 2.4.1 Valuation  Below the Line Data Transactions in foreign currency (for example, borrowing and amortization payments) are expressed in local currency at a fixed exchange rate.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Time of Recording: The accounting procedure for above-the-line operations of the NFPS is as follows: First, the revenue, expenditure and financial flows of the institutions are recorded on a cash basis. After being aggregated and consolidated, they are adjusted to accrual values for general government, public enterprises, and the NFPS, and then reconciled with external sector data (debt service, disbursements) and monetary data (loan statements, deposit statements, and correspondent fiscal accounts). Supplementary Period: There is no supplementary period. 2. Below-the-line data Time of Recording: The transactions are recorded on both an accruals and a cash basis. (a) Recording of transactions on a cash basis: Under ""External Financing"": (i) disbursements and (ii) NFPS deposits in banks abroad; and (iii) debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, which is recorded by combining values on an accruals basis and on a cash basis.

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The central government data for Botswana broadly follows the recommendations of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual except for minor deviations in definition of development expenditure, grants and net lending which will be expanded on below. Revenue includes all non-repayable receipts of government. The tax revenue comprises of income tax both individual and corporate tax, taxes on property, value added tax, mineral tax, SACU revenue and taxes on motor vehicle. Non-tax revenue includes interest earned from domestic lending, property income, mineral royalties and dividends, administrative fees and charges, fines and forfeits, and sale of property. Sale of property comprises of sale of land, sale of livestock and sale of fixed assets. Grants comprise of recurrent and development grants both from abroad and internal. Recurrent expenditure includes personal emoluments, pensions and gratuities, grants and subventions, other charges and public debt interest for both external loans and domestic debt. Grants and subventions represent transfers to Local Authorities, extra budgetary entities and other Institutions outside of Government subscriptions to international organizations and grants to foreign Governments. Personal emoluments cover salaries, wages and allowances of permanent and pensionable employees and casual labour. Pensions and Gratuities comprises of pensions, social contributions and social benefits. Other charges represent all other running costs on the recurrent budget. Development expenditure includes acquisition of fixed capital, government purchases of equity and all forms of Development Fund lending. Net lending covers all loan disbursements and repayments including capitalized interest of loans made by the Public Debt Service Fund to Parastatals, Town/City Councils and other organizations. Repayments for the Development Fund loans are also shown here. Financing includes disbursements and repayments of external and internal loans to government and government's subscription to Botswana's credit tranche position at the IMF. Other financing covers the net movement in below the line accounts including deposits, advances, imprest and other Special Funds' transactions. Change in cash balances shows the monthly net movement in government cash balances. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The entire territory of Botswana is covered.  Transaction coverage includes only the central government cash flow operations. Extra-budgetary accounts are excluded from coverage. There are no social security funds. There are no state governments.  Central government operations:  Government data covers cash flow operations of central government unit covering the recurrent and the development budgets. These include line Ministries and transfers to extra-budgetary entities and Local Authorities. In the recurrent expenditure, transfer to public officers' medical aid scheme on behalf of Local Authorities staff is included but not their operations.  Local government:  Local government in Botswana comprises of nine District Councils, two City Councils and four Town Councils that are accountable to the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. Twelve Land Boards are accountable to the Ministry of Lands and Housing. Currently data for these units are not consolidated into a general government statement. Data on Local government units are instead published in the audited reports that are produced from each unit separately. Local government units do not use the recommended IMF's classification as set out in the 1986 GFS Manual.  Exceptions to coverage  None  Unrecorded activity  None 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Expenditure by major economic classification are disaggregated into recurrent and development expenditure. There is a further classification of expenditure by function.  The analytical presentation of central government operations is generally in accordance with the statistical framework set out in the 1986 GFSM with minor deviations in the description of development expenditure, net lending and grants. The fiscal year runs from April to March.  The data is presented using the following framework:  Total Revenues and Grants  Tax Revenue Non-Tax Revenue Grants  Total Expenditure and Net Lending  Recurrent expenditure Development expenditure Net lending  Overall surplus/deficit  Financing  Net Foreign loans  Net Internal loans Transfer to pension fund IMF transactions  Other financing Change in cash balances 2.4.1 Valuation  All values are at market prices.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The accounting basis for recording government's transactions is on a cash basis.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  All transactions are recorded on a gross basis.",
23,23,24,BRA,Brazil,2014,2014,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Data is compiled following methodology established in IMF´s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2014). The release follows a statement of operations structure, which consists of a summary of government's transactions, detailing revenues, expenses and net investment in nonfinancial assets. The item “financing” is obtained using ""below-the-line"" criterion and corresponds to the nominal variation of the central government net debt balance, excluding some asset adjustments (such as privatization revenues from privatization and incorporation of previous debt). The methodology is described in Manual de Estatísticas Fiscais (the fiscal statistics handbook), available at BCB's website (www.bcb.gov.br). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data covers the following components:The budgetary central government subsector comprises all units included in the federal budget coverage (orçamento fiscal e da seguridade social, fiscal and social security budget). It includes: a) legislative, judiciary, and executive government federal bodies; and b) two social security funds: Regime Próprio de Previdência Social (RPPS), which covers public sector employees, and Regime Geral de Previdência Social (RGPS), that covers private sector workers. BCB is not included in the coverage, once it is included on the public corporations subsector. Transactiosn on financial assets anda liabilities are classified according to the instrumentThe extra-budgetary central government subsector comprises the Fundo Remanescente do PIS/Pasep and the Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Serviço (FGTS), both private funds managed by the government. FGTS assets are invested in housing, sanitation and urban infrastructure and the fund's main revenue source are mandatory deposits from employers.BCB provides interest revenues and expenses.The data on borrowing requirements included in the net aquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities (""below-the-line"") cover the operations of non-financial institutions of the direct and indirect administration, including social security. The Fundo Remanescente do PIS/Pasep and the Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Serviço (FGTS) are not included in the borrowing requirements. Transactions are classified according to the instrument, but as the assets of other accounts receivable and liabilities of other accounts payable are not computed, their transactions affect deposits only when effectively received/paid. 2.4.1 Valuation  The stages of budgetary and financial execution of expenditures are: preparation of budgetary proposal, enactment and publication of the LOA, bidding, commitments, production of goods or services by contractors, settlement, and payment. Expenditure commitments refer to the share of the budget to any given expenditure, with prior indication of creditor and amount. Settlement is the recognition that the expenditure was executed as agreed and acknowledges that the debt as net and accurate. The next and final step is payment, which is carried out by the issue of a bank order in favor of the creditor. Expenditures are recorded at the time of the settlement and there can be lags between settlement and effective disbursement. Considering that an expenditure settlement represents the acknowledgment that it has been properly executed, as well as the right of the creditor to receive the agreed amount, settlements are considered a good proxy for valuing expenditures and are used to create an accrual indicator, including those referring to commitments unsettled in previous years. Revenues are compiled in a cash basis in all statements, except for interest revenues. Nominal interest is appropriated according to the accrual basis. Nominal interest of the central government does not include the BCB.",
24,24,25,BRN,Brunei Darussalam,1986,1986,1986,"2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Central Government data are compiled on a cash basis and the framework is similar to that recommended in the IMF 1986 Manual on Government Finance Statistics (MGFS). Revenue includes all nonrepayable receipts, except for transfers from the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA). Until 2000, oil royalties were paid to the BIA and the BIA would pay to the budget a transfer roughly equivalent to the defined balance. Since 2000, oil royalties have been credited to the budget and BIA transfers have ceased. Expenditure includes all non repayable outlays, plus investment in public enterprises. Loans by government are limited to interest free housing and automobile loans to civil servants, and these are recorded under movements in funds. Financing includes transfers from the BIA, changes in cash balances with the banking system, changes in balance of revolving funds, and loans from the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board. Loans from domestic (and foreign???) banks are not reflected in the fiscal data. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The entire country is covered. All transactions are included in the data, except for bank loans. Data cover all central government agencies except the BIA. There are no local governments in Brunei Darussalam. The government sector is highly centralized; there are no extrabudgetary agencies, except the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), and there are no local governments. The operations of the BIA are not included in the fiscal data, but transfers from the BIA are recorded when they occur. Transactions are recorded on a gross basis, except for refunds of revenue within a fiscal year which are deducted from revenue.The fiscal year is the calendar year. The quarterly data are presented in millions of Brunei dollars as follows: Total revenue  Tax revenue  Taxes on net income and profits  Corporate tax  Oil and gas  Other companies  Individuals (estate duty  Stamp duty  Import duties  Motor vehicle taxes  Tobacco  Others  Taxes on goods and services  Nontax revenue  Property income  Oil sector  Other  Administrative fees and charges and sales of goods Total expenditure  Current  Wages and salaries  OCAR (Other charges annually recurrent)  Charged expenditure  Capital  OCSE (Other charges special expenditure—non-Development Plan capital outlays)  Development expenditureBudget Surplus/Deficit Exceptions to coverage  Loans to government are not shown in the disseminated data. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Revenue is classified into categories similar to those recommended in MGFS. There is no detailed classification of expenditure either by economic type or by function. Expenditure is broken down into current and capital outlays. Current expenditure includes wages and salaries, other charges annually recurrent (OCAR), and charged expenditure. OCAR corresponds to other payment on goods and services. Charged expenditure includes payment of oil royalties and other payments (civil list) to the royal family, payments of pensions, and salaries of certain officials including the judiciary and auditor general. Capital expenditure includes development plan outlays, capital expenditures of government agencies that are not included in the development plan, and investments in public enterprises. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation: Transactions are recorded at market value. Foreign currency denominated transactions are converted at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of the transactions.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: Data are recorded on a cash basis. Expenditure is recorded when checks are written. Revenue is recorded when checks or cash is received. However, foreign-currency-denominated receipts are recorded when notice is received from the bank.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Central government data are prepared in accordance with the statistical framework defined in the IMF's 1986 edition of the ""Government Finance Statistics Manual"". In Burkina Faso's statistical framework: (i) revenue includes nonrepayable government receipts; (ii) grants constitute unrequited nonrepayable transfers to government; (iii) expenditure includes nonfinancial obligations and financial transactions by government for general policy purposes; (iv) financing represents financial transactions for liquidity purposes. These budgetary data are compiled every month on a cash flow basis for budget execution. These data are compiled in accordance with the recommendations of the Manual, but show the overall balance and the primary balance. Monthly information is published on central government domestic and external financing. These budgetary data are compiled every month on a cash flow basis for budget execution. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The data are compiled in thousands of CFA francs and presented in the government financial operations table (TOFE). The data cover central government budgetary units alone. The transactions of public enterprises, local governments, and the social security fund are not covered. The fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, but there is a supplementary period that runs up until the last day of February, during which investment expenditure commitments continue to be honored and are posted to the commitment year. Several balances are compiled at year-end: the overall balance, which is the difference between total revenue per se and grants and total expenditure and net lending; the overall balance excluding grants and restructuring expenditure; the basic primary balance. Revenues - Tax revenue (from production, income, and consumption) is broken down into income and profit taxes, taxes payable by employers on wages and labor, property taxes, taxes on goods and services, taxes on trade and international transactions, and other tax revenue. - Nontax revenue is broken down into property income, administrative fees and charges, and nonindustrial sales, fines and confiscation, and other nontax revenue. - Capital revenue is subdivided into sales of fixed assets-stocks-land and intangible assets and other capital revenue. - Grants are divided into adjustment grants and project grants. Expenditure - Current expenditure is broken down into expenditure on wages, expenditure on goods and services, interest on the debt, interest on the debt and current transfers. - Investment expenditure (capital and investment expenditure) is broken down by type of financing: the government's own resources, grants, and loans. Interest on the public debt is divided into domestic and external debt. The cash budget balance for the current year is determined after balancing out the obligations pending from previous fiscal years. In the absence of that balancing, adjustments are made for the arrears in order to calculate the overall balance of the budget. Financing is detailed by origin of the funds: Central Bank, commercial banks, postal checking accounts (CCP), and National Savings Bank (CNE), nonbank sector, changes in Treasury deposits, and privatization receipts.  Exceptions to coverage  The operations of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS), and those of public enterprises and local governments are not covered (see plans for improvement). Government grants and transfers to extrabudgetary units and local governments are not taken into account in central government expenditure. Unrecorded activity  All activities are recorded. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The detailed functional classification of expenditure follows the nomenclature and budgetary classification of the organic statute governing the budget laws of Burkina Faso. The data published in the budget law and in the annexes to the budget show the following classification of resources: revenue, aid, grants, subsidies, and borrowing. A functional and an economic classification are adopted for current expenditure, while a functional classification is used for capital/investment expenditure and capital transfers. Lastly, overall figures for public debt payments are presented. The detailed data for the analytical framework defined above are available in the following classification categories: tax revenue classified by tax; nontax revenue classified by type of revenue. Current expenditure is classified by economic type (wages, goods and services, current transfers, and debt service); capital expenditure classified by source of financing; capital transfers by type. The net lending item is not broken down. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Revenues are recorded on the basis of actual collections (Directorate General of Taxes and the Directorate General of Treasury and Government Accounting) and on an accruals basis (customs revenue). Expenditure is posted on a commitments basis. The cash budget balance for the current year is determined after balancing out the obligations pending from previous fiscal years. In the absence of that balancing, adjustments are made for the arrears in order to calculate the overall balance of the budget.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The budget frameworks used are defined in the Budget Framework Law (Law 78/V/98 of December 7, 1998) and are classified in accordance with the revenue and expenditure classifiers. The budget is executed pursuant to the law establishing the rules and procedures for budget execution; these rules are largely consistent with the internationally accepted recommendations. The analytical framework used is consistent with the recommendations of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) of 1998, but with a few differences: The revenue and expenditure of central government units with administrative and financial autonomy (autonomous services and funds) are classified as autonomous revenue under nontax revenue and as autonomous expenditure under current expenditure. As recommended in the GFSM, The concept of total revenue, in addition to receipts that do not generate a repayment obligation also includes repayments of loans granted to public enterprises (pass-through loans – external debt), grants, and transfers from other domestic sources, such as participation by public enterprises in the costs of government projects. Emergency expenditure to deal with the effects of the 1998 drought is classified separately as extraordinary social expenditure. The central government sector is defined in accordance with the GFSM recommendations and includes central government units strictly speaking, as well as units of the central government with administrative and financial autonomy (autonomous services and funds). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The coverage of the data is national. The data cover all central government units (national general offices, services, autonomous institutes, and funds). They do not cover municipalities (local government), the data of which are presented in an annex to the Government General Accounts. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Revenue is classified using an economic classification and expenditure using organic, functional, and economic classifications. Over time, these classifications have been changed, sometimes significantly, and this complicates analysis of the performance of government revenue and expenditure. The data are disseminated with the following structure: (A) SUMMARY OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL OPERATIONS (A1) Total revenue Fiscal revenue  Current revenue  Tax revenue  Nontax revenue Principal payments by public enterprises Grants Transfers from Other Domestic Sources (OFN) (A2) Total expenditure Operating expenditure  Of which:  Scheduled interest on domestic debt  Scheduled interest on external debt Investment expenditure Extraordinary social expenditure OVERALL BALANCE (commitment basis) Overall balance excluding grants Current balance (difference between current revenue and operating expenditure) Primary balance (difference between balance excl. grants + interest – Other Domestic Sources) Budgetary balance (difference between fiscal revenue and operating expenditure) (A3) Financing External (net)  Disbursements  Bridge Loan  Amortization  Change in arrears (increase +)  Interest  Principal Payment of prior year’s arrears Rescheduling of arrears Domestic (net) Banking system  New borrowing (net)  Of which:  Treasury bonds  Treasury bills  Change in arrears Other New borrowing Of which:  Treasury bond  Treasury bill Amortization Change in arrears Of which: Privatization receipts (B) CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE Central government revenue is disaggregated in accordance with the following classification: (B1) Tax revenue Tax on income and profits Business profits tax Sole income tax Professional tax Complementary tax Other taxes Tax on international trade Tax on imports  Import duties  Consumption tax  General customs fees Other Other taxes Stamp tax Tax on petroleum products Tax on alcoholic beverages and tobacco (B2) Nontax revenue Permits and miscellaneous fees Property income Transfers Sales of assets and services Autonomous revenue Other revenue (B3) Total current revenue Repayment of principal by public enterprises Total fiscal revenue Fiscal revenue including municipal taxes (collected by the central government and transferred to the municipalities) (C) The economic classification of central government expenditure is disaggregated as follows: Total current revenue  Salaries and wages  Voluntary separation program (PAV – part of the general government reform, for the purpose of reducing general government staffing levels)  Goods and services  Current interest  Domestic  External  Subsidies and transfers  Public enterprises  Public sector  Other entities  Autonomous expenditure (corresponding to the so-called memorandum accounts)  Other current expenditure  Capital expenditure  Other expenditure Investment expenditure Extraordinary social expenditure (emergency program to deal with the effects of the 1998 drought) Transfers to autonomous services and funds are classified as transfers to the public sector.

The main components of the TOFE are: Total revenue Total oil revenue Nonoil revenue, including tax (direct taxes on petroleum products, on international trade, and other taxes on goods and services) and nontax revenue; grants identified (from the European Union and for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)), which are now included; Total expenditure Current expenditure (wages, other goods and services, transfers and subsidies, interest payments on external debt and domestic debt) Capital expenditure (foreign financing, project aid, own resources, restructuring) Overall balance on a commitments basis and on a cash basis; Changes in payments arrears; Foreign and domestic financing; Primary balance. Capital expenditure covers foreign-financed investment expenditure, domestically-financed investment expenditure, expenditure on rehabilitation and on restructuring. The balance of revenue and expenditure yields the overall balance on a commitments and on a cash basis; the overall balance on a cash basis is obtained by adding the changes in external and domestic payments arrears. Total financing includes external financing and domestic financing. External financing records negative debt amortization and loans received for investment projects or structural adjustment support. Domestic financing comprises bank financing, nonbank financing, plus any securitization. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction CoverageThe transactions covered are: Fiscal revenue (current and capital); Fiscal expenditure (current and capital); Cash operations. Geographic CoverageNational coverage encompasses about 95 percent of government transactions because of time lags caused by delays in the transmission of data from remote stations.

31,31,32,CAN,Canada,2001,2014,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical framework and concepts: The central government monthly transaction data disseminated under the SDDS are organized by major fiscal aggregates ̶ revenue, expense, deficit/surplus, and breakdown of financing ̶ using the system of definitions and classifications in the Chart of Accounts for the Government of Canada. Relationship with international guidelines: The purpose of the Fiscal Monitor is to present the monthly financial highlights and details of the government's fiscal performance. The published data are compiled according to the accounting guidelines established by the central government, which are based on Canadian public sector accounting standards set by the independent Public Sector Accounting Board. This monthly information is the essential source data used by Statistics Canada to assemble the quarterly SNA data and the annual GFSM. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Institutional coverage of central government in reported data: Data disseminated cover the operations of the budgetary central government. The reporting entity includes all departments, agencies, corporations and funds which are controlled by the federal government. Exceptions to coverage  Data on the contributory public pension fund (the Canada Pension Plan, or CPP) are excluded from the data as changes to the CPP require the agreement of two thirds of participating provinces and it is therefore not controlled by the central government. Data on the central government extra-budgetary funds, and the contributory public pension fund (the Canada Pension Plan) are excluded from the data. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification system: A central classification system (Chart of Accounts for the Government of Canada) is used to compile the components of the major fiscal aggregates included in the monthly data. Revenues are classified by source and consist of tax and non-tax revenues entering into the calculation of the budgetary deficit/surplus. Expenses include all charges broken down by type entering into the calculation of the budgetary deficit/surplus. Financing is broken down by instrument and divided into internal (non-market) sources and external sources (market debt). Market debt is further broken down into financing repayable in domestic currency and financing repayable in foreign currencies. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted into Canadian dollar equivalents using prevailing market rates. Monetary assets and liabilities are converted using the closing rate in effect at the end of each reporting period.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: Transactions are accounted for on a full accrual accounting basis. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustment for grossing and netting of transactions: Revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/13-605-x/2014005/article/14088-eng.pdf?st=Y3rYjUS8

The analytical framework used is the one defined in ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" (GFSM), (IMF, 1986). The main components of the TOFE produced and disseminated are: Total revenue and grants; - tax revenue (direct and indirect taxes, taxes on international trade) - nontax revenue (administrative revenue and other nontax revenue) - project grants and current grants Total expenditure - primary expenditure (wages, goods & services, transfers, food security) - current expenditure ( primary expenditure, external and domestic debt interest payments) - capital expenditure (foreign financing (borrowing), project grants, own resources, restructuring) Balances - Primary balance = total revenue excluding grants - primary expenditure - Current balance = total revenue excluding grants - current expenditure - Overall balance (on a commitments basis) excluding grants = total revenue excluding grants - total expenditure (current expenditure + investment expenditure from domestic resources) - Overall balance (on a commitments basis) including grants = total revenue and grants - total expenditure - Balance on a cash basis = balance on a commitments basis + changes in payments arrears Changes in payments arrears = committed expenditure - disbursed expenditure - repayment of domestic and external debt arrears (from prior years) Total financing includes external financing and domestic financing. External financing records negative debt relief as a positive amount and debt repayment as a negative amount; loans received for investment projects or for structural adjustment support. Domestic financing comprises bank financing (central bank and primary banks), nonbank financing (proceeds from asset transfers), plus any securitization. - Financing needs = Balance on a cash basis + financing - Gap = Financing needs + exceptional financing (bilateral and multilateral assistance) There is currently no ""lending minus repayments"" item in Chad's TOFE. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction CoverageThe transactions covered are: - fiscal revenue (tax, nontax, grants, and borrowing); - fiscal expenditure (personnel, goods and services, transfers, and external and domestic debt service payments); - cash operations. Geographic CoverageThe TOFE covers all the government’s fiscal operations throughout the Chadian territory. Unit Coverage- The TOFE covers central government operations relative to the state budget. The scope of the definition of government covers the central government (office of the president, supreme court, constitutional court, and ministries) and excludes the communes, the national pension fund, and the national social security fund.  Exceptions to coverage  The transactions not covered are those pertaining to grants in kind. Unrecorded activity  Transactions by the communes and social security funds (CNRT, CNPS). 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification system is generally the one recommended in the IMF’s 1986 “GFSM”, unless otherwise indicated in this text. 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions in goods and services are valued at market rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the market rate at the time of the transaction.  2.4.2 Recording basis  All revenue is recorded on a cash basis; operating and investment expenditure as well as interest on the public debt are recorded on a commitments basis. The fiscal year starts on January 1 of year N and ends on December 31 of the same year. But, there is a supplementary period from January 1 to February 28 of year N+1, during which time operations corresponding to that supplementary period are excluded from the fiscal year and those corresponding to the preceding supplementary period are included. Other specific operations and their accounting (arrears on taxes subject to netting, oil bonus, quasi-fiscal operations, etc.) are neither compiled nor published.",

The main components of the government financial survey can be rearranged to correspond to the components in the IMF Manual (1986 edition). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage Current and special fiscal revenue and exceptional revenue Current and special fiscal expenditure and capital expenditure Nonbudgeted transactions (withholdings at source from MIBA, GECAMINES, and the oil producers) Cash transactions (extrabudgetary) Transactions not covered: Revenue and expenditure from: Special budgets Annexed budgets Decentralized administrative units  The government financial survey covers central government operations, namely those of the Office of the President, the Assembly, and the Ministries (budgetary revenue and expenditure). Institutional units not covered: The decentralized administrative units (EAD), the units authorizing the special budgets and annexed budgets. The units authorizing special budgets or special funds are the units that generate revenue and use it for pre-defined expenditure, such as the Tourism Promotion Fund. The units authorizing annexed budgets are autonomous units and other administrative public institutions, such as the universities, hospitals, and the National Institute of Statistics. It is noteworthy that the list of units authorizing special budgets and annexed budgets varies from one year to the next.  The following data are disseminated monthly in billions of Congolese francs: Total revenue in the government financial survey, the main source of which is the list of recorded transactions of the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) and revenue-generating units: Trade and excise taxes: Customs and Excise Office (OFIDA) Income, profit, and turnover taxes: General Directorate of Taxes (DGC) Fees and incidental taxes: Quarries and Mines (GECAMINES) Fees and incidental taxes: Bakwanga Mining (MIBA) Royalties and license fees: Oil producers Incidental taxes: Oil distributors Nontax revenue, repayments of loans and advances: General Directorate of Administrative and State Revenues (DGRAD) Repayment of loans and advances Other (unitemized revenue)  The total revenue in the government financial survey is broken down into current revenue and special budget (budgets pour ordre) revenue on the one hand, and exceptional revenue (project grants, project loans, bridging loans) on the other hand. The main source of expenditure data is the BCC’s list of recorded transactions. Total expenditure in the government financial survey consists of current expenditure and special budget expenditure, capital expenditure, and the other categories of expenditure, called, as applicable, expenditure for adjustment or unitemized expenditure. Current expenditure covers the following expenditure categories: Remuneration Public debt: external debt, domestic debt, and carrying charges Subsidies and transfers (economic subsidies and intervention) Operating costs (other goods and services) Capital expenditure, which is investment made by the government with its own financing or with foreign financing Expenditure for adjustment  The cash-basis balance is the difference between revenue and expenditure. A current balance (including special budget operations) is also calculated, representing the difference between current revenue and current expenditure. The financing part of the balance (cash basis) of the government financial survey covers only bank domestic financing (net credit to the government) and nonbank domestic financing (underwriting and repayment of certificates of deposit or Treasury bills). 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification system used is that of the budget law, which is based on the 1997 budget classification. Revenue is recorded by income-generating units, and expenditure is classified by economic type. Expenditure pending adjustment is expenditure for which an emergency procedure was used (failure to observe the expenditure procedure). Such expenditure is recorded in the subaccounts for advances on the books of the BCC. Unitemized expenditure relates to items that cannot be classified in any of the above-mentioned expenditure categories because of a lack of specific information on their type. The government financial survey makes no mention of grants or of domestic and external payment arrears. Similarly, financing is not sufficiently broken down by creditor and provides no information on the breakdown by instrument. 2.4.2 Recording basis  All government operations are recorded on a cash basis using single-entry accounting.",
39,39,40,COG,"Congo, Rep.",1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The analytical framework used is the government flow of funds table (TOFE), which generally conforms to the publication - A Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM), (IMF, 1986). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage The transactions cover general budget operations (current and investment), annexed budgets and special accounts (exclusively receiving budget transfers or earmarked taxes, and of which the main activities consist in providing nonmarket services). Geographic Coverage Government operations cover the entire national territory. Unit Coverage The TOFE covers the central government, which consists of the Office of the President, National Assembly, Supreme Court, ministries, and administrative public establishments.  Unrecorded activity  Information on (humanitarian) grants in kind is not always available. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The main components of the TOFE that are produced, but not disseminated, are: 1. Total fiscal revenues and grants, which are broken into (i) fiscal revenue (oil and non-oil revenue) and (ii) grants. Oil revenue comprises oil royalties, taxes (prior to the production sharing contract), production sharing (oil profits), cargos, bonuses and licenses, provision for diversified investments, and other special revenue, as relevant. Non-oil revenue refers to taxes (including domestic fees), customs duties (import-export), oil and gas tax which has been replaced since September 2002 by a VAT on oil products and revenue from services collected by the Treasury. Grants are those unrequited transfers from various donors. This information is not fully controlled by the Directorate of Programming responsible for collecting related data. 2. Total budget expenditure includes: Current expenditure comprising wages and salaries, equipment, regular operating costs, transfers excluding investment expenditure, net expenditure of local governments, and interest on the debt. Interest on the debt includes domestic interest (including those on overdrafts from the Bank of Central African States and other primary banks) plus interest on external contractual debt; Investment expenditure (externally and domestically financed); Expenditure in the form of net lending, which is the difference between loans granted to public enterprises (or to establishments) minus repayments. 3. The primary balance is the difference between domestic revenue (oil and non-oil) and domestic expenditure (wages, equipment, regular operating costs, transfers, local governments, and investment expenditure from own resources). Domestic expenditure for interest falling due on domestic debt is excluded. 4. The balance on a commitments basis is the difference between total fiscal revenue and expenditure (including or excluding grants, as relevant). 5. Changes in payment arrears constitute the difference between outstanding arrears at the end of a particular month and those at December 31 of the previous year. The data are broken down into changes in domestic arrears and in external arrears. The outstanding arrears for the month is the difference between the debt service of principal and interest falling due and the actual payments. Monthly debt service is the difference between gross debt service falling due minus cancellations, reschedulings, and payments made during the month. Changes in external arrears exclude cancellations, reschedulings, and the actual payments of the debt to the IMF; the latter is included in the internal monetary system, in the government’s net position (domestic financing). Changes in domestic debt are subdivided into purely domestic debt and ""other"" debt. The line “other” mainly comprises the remainder of debt to be collected. 6. Balance on a cash basis is the sum of the balance on a commitments basis (including grants) and changes in arrears. 7. Financing of the balance on a cash basis is obtained as follows:  At the external level, by adding (i) gross drawings (project loans, non-project loans, and loans collateralized with oil); (ii) amortization of the external debt; (iii) cancellation of the debt; and (iv) debt rescheduling.  At the domestic level, by adding (i) bank financing (defined as the change in the government’s net position with the central bank, including the IMF) and (ii) non-bank financing. Non-bank financing is the sum of the following lines: proceeds from privatization, costs of bank and financial reforms (related to restructuring the banking system), costs of structural reforms (related to the liabilities of privatized enterprises and often consisting of claims paid to workers of privatized public enterprises), cancellation of the domestic debt, issues of securities, non-budgeted exceptional oil revenue, amortization of the domestic and other debt. Since the recent IMF consultation review in Brazzaville, the line “other” now comprises mainly (i) the difference between the customs revenue and taxes (sources: Treasury and DGD, DGI) and (ii) adjustment for the financing gap. 2.4.1 Valuation  Goods and services are valued at market prices.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Fiscal revenue is recorded on the basis of the government’s accrued claims on the Directorate-General of Customs, Directorate-General of Taxes, oil companies; fiscal expenditure is recorded on a payment due basis. Oil revenue (royalties, production sharing, shipments, provisions for investment diversification, bonus) are recorded on a gross basis and do not take account of withholdings by oil companies for (i) debt, (ii) the levy by the national oil company (SNPC) (1.6 percent of the cost of marketing government oil), (iii) financial expenses for SNPC/shipments, (iv) investment, (v) transfers or subsidies to the marine sector, (vi) fuel. Tax revenue (prepayment—PPA—and collection by assessment) and customs revenue (imports/exports and taxes) are recorded on a cash basis, i.e., collections at the Customs and Tax Administration departments (assessment units)' Current expenditure (personnel, equipment, regular operating costs, transfers, local government) is recorded on a payment order basis. Domestic and external interest is recorded on a commitments basis, that is, interest due. Domestic interest includes not only interest on contractual debt, but also interest on overdrafts from the Central Bank, and possibly certain primary banks (CAIC, BGFI, Crédit Lyonnais, former BIDC). The data are expressed in billions of CFA francs.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Forecasting Directorate of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Côte d'Ivoire compiles exhaustive and detailed monthly data on central government operations. The data are disseminated in the government flow of funds table (TOFE), in accordance with the statistical framework described in the 1986 edition of the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"", with the following breakdown: - Revenue, which includes nonrepayable government funds, collected by the financial administrations. These include: tax revenue collected from direct taxes, taxes on goods and services, and import duties and taxes; nontax revenue, comprising stabilization surpluses, social security contributions, revenue from the special Treasury accounts, and other revenue (e.g oil and gas); grants, which are nonrepayable noncompulsory resources, divided into project grants and budgetary assistance; - Expenditure, comprising government nonfinancial obligations and nonrepayable financial operations executed by the government. It is subdivided into current and capital expenditure, and interest payments on the domestic and external debt. - Financing, which represents transactions by government for liquidity purposes. It includes domestic and external financing. The detailed functional classification of expenditure, in particular, follows the nomenclature and budgetary classification of the organic statute governing the budget laws of Côte d'Ivoire. From these data, which are compiled every month on the basis of monthly flows, management balances are derived (including the primary basic balance, the overall balance), for the purpose of monitoring budget execution and the government's financial position. They also show which type of financing the government used to fund its deficit or how it used its budget surplus . The central government operations are also disseminated by the BCEAO in the ""Annual Report"" and provide a detailed annual breakdown between resources, expenditure and financing. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data on government operations presented in the TOFE cover: - Government budget: central government current and capital expenditure for ministries, other public services, special accounts, public funds, project accounts; - Special Treasury accounts - Agricultural Product Price Support and Stabilization Fund (CSSPPA) - General pension fund for government employees (CGRAE) - National Social Welfare Fund (CNPS) The data cover all the transactions of the units listed above on the national territory and in the diplomatic representations. Exceptions to coverage  The coverage does not comprise debt of public enterprises.  Unrecorded activity  There is no specific coverage of unreported activities. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The detailed classifications of these aggregates are as follows: 1. Resources - Tax revenue (direct taxes, taxes on goods and services, import and export duties and taxes), and nontax revenue (stabilization surpluses, social security contributions, special Treasury revenue); - Grants, divided into project loans and budgetary assistance. 2. Expenditure - Current expenditure (personnel expenditure+ welfare payments+ subsidies and other transfers) + other operating expenditure + targeted social expenditure; - Investment expenditure (expenditure on project loans + financial expenditure using budgetary assistance); - Expenditure on public debt interest payments (expenditure on domestic debt service + expenditure on external debt service). 3. Financing - Domestic financing is broken down into central bank financing, commercial bank financing, nonbank sector financing (public enterprises + compulsory resources + treasury correspondents + sales of assets and proceeds from privatization, supplier credits). - External financing is divided into bank assets, loans, budgetary assistance, rescheduling, and accumulation of arrears. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Revenue is recorded on a cash basis and expenditure on an accrual basis. Advances on the budget for a given reference year are recorded as expenditure although the budget year has not formally started. They are subsequently regularized so that, at the end of the supplementary periods, posted expenditure is completely covered by payment orders. The fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, with one relatively long supplementary period for current expenditure. Noncommitted capital expenditure is carried forward to the following year. However, this approach is not used in cash basis accounting.",

Revenue includes non-repayable receipts other than foreign grants. Expenditure includes non-repayable outlays. All transactions giving rise to changes in the government's financial assets and liabilities are treated as financing, except for government loans for policy purposes which are treated above the line as net lending. Monthly data are compiled in the Treasury's ""Monthly Statements of Revenue and Expenditure"". The data are presented broadly in accordance with the statistical framework of the IMF's 1986 ""Government Finance Statistics Manual"", albeit in a more aggregate form. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data cover the budget of the Central Government only.

Exceptions to coverage  The social security funds are not included in central government, as they are considered part of nonfinancial public sector. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification System: The classification is based on the 2001 Manual de Ingresos (revenue manual) and the 2001 Manual de Gastos (expenditure manual) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which are comparable to the Government Finance Statistics Manual published by the International Monetary Fund in 2001. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: On January 10, 2000, Ecuador dollarized its economy. Since February 2000, the exchange rate of 25,000 sucres per dollar has been used to convert operations from sucres into dollars. For time series, the Central Bank of Ecuador's average monthly selling rate on the intervention market was used.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: Government finance statistics measure the flow of revenue and expenditure between the government and the rest of the economy, on a monthly basis. The central government accounts use cash-basis recording; the data are generally provisional and are corrected when the definitive figures are obtained. The central government outturn is prepared on the basis of the financial statements provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which are cash basis, as unpaid liabilities are not included. Complementary period: There is no complementary period. The recording period refers to the calendar year only.",

52,52,53,GNQ,Equatorial Guinea,,,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Central Government data is processed in accordance with CEMAC Directives’ analytical, conceptual and classifications framework on harmonization of public finance management. These directives are based in turn on the Manual of Public Finance Statistics for the year 2014. Community Directive No. 04/11-UEAC-190-CM-22, of December 19 on the Government Budget Classification establishes the fundamental principles governing presentation of Government Budgets, budgets of the autonomous entities and other public entities of member states of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) operations. Article 17 of the Community Text on Budget Classification applicable to CEMAC member states establishes that “national legislation on budget classification must conform, where necessary, to the provisions of said Directive within 24 months of its approval and adoption by the Central African Economic and Monetary Community…” Budget discussions are held in the first quarter of the year to enable ministerial departments and autonomous entities present their revenue and expenditure estimates for the following fiscal year. The National Treasury is responsible for providing the expenditure data for these departments and entities. Once the Central Government annual budget compilation and preparation process is complete, the compatibility of the disaggregated data with the aggregated data of the analytical framework is checked, as is the compatibility of the balance sheet of above-the-line data with the total financing data. Historical series data are also published to facilitate comparisons with the new data. The methodology used is that recommended by the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), in its Directive N° 01/11-UEAC-190-CM-22, General Budget Laws. CEMAC serves notice on any changes to the methodology and they are issued on the strength of Presidential decree; all of which is published in the Official Bulletin. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The State Financial Operations Tables cover all budget operations concerned and applied by the central government. The scope of this definition includes the Presidency and the Prime Minister’s and similar offices, the Parliament (Upper and Lower Houses), National Boards, Socio-Economic- Councils, Autonomous Agencies, Subsidies to local Corporations (except for their income and expenditure data), the ministries and all subsidies to agencies and organizations of different kinds. The annual budgets are drafted with objective, honest and realistic projections as much as possible, with regards to the formulation of strategies and income and expenditure estimates. While drafting National Budgets, possible or potential fiscal risks registered for the following year are identified and evaluated and included in a report to be sent to Parliament together with the rest of the documents that goes with relevant Law on National Budgets. The annual budgets are realistic and objective as regards both their income and expenditure estimates. The general State budgets identify the principal fiscal risks, which are assessed in a report that is remitted to Parliament together with the budget documents. Supporting the budget documentation, a description is provided of the principal revenue and expenditure measures, with an indication of the contributions they make towards achieving economic policy objectives and their compliance with major public policies. To prepare budgets, discussions are held in the first quarter of the year, to enable the various departments to present their revenue and expenditure estimates for the following year. Central Government data are compiled using the analytical framework, concepts, and classifications of the CEMAC Directives for harmonizing public financial management. Transactions are currently recorded on a cash basis, but work is being done on introducing accrual-based records. Unit coverage: The available data refer to Central Government, excluding autonomous entity transactions financed with own funds and the transactions of local corporations. They do, however, include total Central Government transfers to those entities. Transaction coverage: Some adjustments are made for grants received in kind, the value of which is recorded as revenue and expenditure. There is also offsetting with government-owned enterprises, which usually explains any differences when accounts are closed/ Geographic coverage: Local corporation (municipality) transactions are not included, just Central Government transactions.  Exceptions to coverage  Not applicable 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The main components of the TOFE that are produced are: Letter “A”: Revenues Title I.- Non-Oil Revenues Chapter I.- Tax Revenues Chapter II.- Non-Tax Income Chapter III.- Non-Tax Income to Regularize Title II.- Oil Revenues Chapter I.- Tax Revenues Chapter II.- Non-Tax Income Letter “B” : Expenses Title I.- Current Expenses Chapter I.- Staff Expenses Chapter II.- Current Assets and Services Chapter III.- Financial Expenses Chapter IV.- Subsidies and Transfers Chapter IX.- Interests on the Debt Title II.- Investment Expenses Chapter V.- Financing Various Projects Chapter V.

The accounting procedure for recording revenue and expenditure is as follows: Revenue is recorded on a cash basis, while expenditures are a combination of cash transactions and non-cash flow transactions (mainly investments project-related payments). Once the data has been aggregated and consolidated, they are adjusted to obtain the values that appear in the Government Financial Transactions Table. These data are reconciled with external sector and monetary sector data. Currently transactions are being recorded on a cash basis, although efforts are being made on developing a way to record them on an accrual basis.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Revenue and are recorded in cash. As for expenditure: current expenditure is registered on cash bases, whereas capital expenditure is registered on commitment bases. The exchange rate for oil revenue is the one used by the financial market, calculated by converting the dollar value to local currency. The Office of the Director General for Budgets and State Property has acquired a data base program with which to handle accounting and Budget analyses, accounts and finance management, logistics. Human resources, projects, costs and billing, e-procurement and business Intelligence management, which is currently underutilized.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  The is still a lack of those tools necessary of internationally accepted standard of revenue collection.",

56,56,57,ETH,Ethiopia,2001,2001,2001,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Ethiopia has a federal mode of government. The Federal Government, nine State Governments and two City Administrations constitute the General Government. These governments and city administrations have their own legal power to proclaim and administer their own respective budget. Recently, the devolution of power evolved to districts in the majority of the state Governments and City Administrations. As a result, the districts also have their own legal power to proclaim and administer their own respective budget. The remaining State Governments allocate budgets to zonal, special district and district councils. The districts are responsible to report to their respective State Governments or City Administrations. According to the constitution, the Federal Government, as a central body, grants and control resources to State Governments and City Administrations as subsidies to finance their fiscal deficits. The Budget Manual, which was introduced in fiscal year 2000/2001 is the major framework for organizing fiscal operations. The manual comprises the detail guidelines and descriptions about the chart of accounts, budget preparations and presentation for the federal government. The Federal Government of Ethiopia Financial Administration Proclamation, Proclamation No. 57/1996 can also be considered as a guiding principle as to how the fiscal information is to be consolidated, according to articles 50 and 51 of Part Ten of this law. Though there is no documented material on methodology and procedure on which the analytical framework for the preparation of fiscal data is based, the preliminary fiscal information is produced by the Macro Economy Policy and Management Department (Macro Department) of MoFED for Budgetary Federal Government by providing on-job training for the personnel responsible for the compilation of the data and preparation of analytical reports. The preparation of the fiscal information is also partly based on A Manual on Government Finance Statistics published by the Fund in 2001. The State Governments consolidate their respective fiscal information based on a similar framework and send reports to MoFED, where these reports are consolidated with the federal fiscal information to produce the general government fiscal report. The compiled data are presented in the form of a table on the fiscal performance of Federal Government, State Governments and General Government in detail and summarized form in both Amharic (official language) and English versions as follows: Total Revenue and Grants Revenue Tax Revenue Direct taxes Indirect taxes Domestic indirect taxes Import duties and taxes Export taxes Non-tax revenue Grants Grants in kind/earmarked Untied cash and CPF/grants Total Expenditure Current expenditure Defense Poverty-targeted expenditure Education Health Agriculture Roads HIPC poverty targeted expenditure Interest payments Domestic interest External interest External assistance (food & related relief aid) Others O/w Wages & salaries Civil salary & allowance Military & police salary Capital expenditure Central Treasury External assistance External Loans Overall balance including grants Overall balance excluding grants Financing External (net) Gross borrowing Amortization paid Domestic (net) Banking system Non-bank sources Privatization Other and residual Revenue consists of non repayable receipts of the central government, except that repayments of loans are also classified as revenue. Expenditure consists of government non repayable outlays plus loans. The GFSM concept of lending minus repayments is therefore not separately identified in this format. Supplemental Information: Macro Department produces a quarterly bulletin, known as Macro Economic Development Report, which consists of analytical information on the prevailing economic situation of the country. The bulletin reaches a few numbers of internal and external users due to limitation of resources in its publication. MoFED publishes the detail budgetary and actual revenue and expenditure data (Published Account (PA) in short) annually, based on the closed government accounts of both Federal and State Governments annually. This task actually has a lag of about one year for Federal Government operations while there is a lag of two years for State Governments operations. Government financial operations are also published in the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) Quarterly Bulletin and Annual Report. Detailed annual data are disseminated on tax and non tax revenue, and current and capital expenditures are presented in a functional classification. Quarterly revenue and expenditure data are also disseminated, but with less detail. Central Statistical Authority (CSA) also publishes government finance operations in the annual statistical book, ""Statistical Abstract,"" but in different presentation. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The Federal Government Operations cover the national territory and outside the national territory for diplomatic offices located outside the country where as the State Governments operations covers only their respective regions. Unit Coverage for Federal Government Operations: All budgetary units are covered in the preparation of monthly reports except those not disbursed by treasury but financed by their retained revenue. However, annual closed accounts (PA) include all operations financed with retained revenue. The operations of social security Agency are not covered in the central or general government operations. The units covered in the State Governments are similar to units covered in the Federal Government. The operations of zonal and district councils which constitutes the local-government are included in the State governments operations and are covered in the general government operations, though their operations are not separately reflected. Unit Coverage for General Government Operations(as encouraged extension): The General Government covers Federal and State Governments budgetary operations. Also included in the General Government are the city administration of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. Reporting system is established to capture the fiscal operations of social security agency. Operation of urban municipalities is not reperted separately. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Detail and summary data is compiled and will be used for internal consumption for producing analytical fiscal performance report. The data is produced on monthly, quarterly and annual basis in accordance with the classification given in the above format. Government Finance Reports prepared for the IMF assumes the formats provided by the Fund, lending minus repayments operations are separately identified. Reports are also produced by economic and functional classifications. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation: All transactions are recorded in local currency at the exchange rate applicable at the time of each operation.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: The transactions on the Federal Government and State Governments are generally recorded on a single entry cash basis accounting system. Monthly expenditure payments are recorded based on the authorization to spend by the budgetary institutions (BIs) made by the Central Treasury (CT). After BIs issued the checks to payees, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) records change in the deposit accounts in the period in which the check is cashed. Therefore, for the mentioned reason there can always be a difference in fiscal and monetary data as reported by the NBE and that reflected in Central Treasury.",https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/CR/2020/English/1ETHEA2020001.ashx
57,57,58,FJI,Fiji,,,,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Government Cashflow Statement follows the framework and structure of the IMF's Government Finance Statistics (GFS) reporting. Although it is specific to Fiji case, it will gradually move towards fully fledged GFS format. Fiscal Balance: Government fiscal balance is derived by adding net cash flows from operating activities and net cash flows from investing activities. Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities: comprises total operating receipts (direct taxes, indirect taxes not including SEG13 VAT, and non-tax revenues (fees, fines & charges, grants, other revenue & surpluses, reimbursement and recoveries etc.)) less total operating payments (personnel emoluments, operating transfer payments, supplies and consumables, purchase of outputs, interest on debt, and other operating payments). This balance also represents Government Operating Savings performance. Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities: comprises total Investing receipts (sale of Government assets, interest from bank balance, interest on term loans & advances, and return on surplus capital from investment) less total investing payments (loans, capital transfer payments, and purchase of physical non-current assets). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data scope covers budgetary units of central government. There are no extra budgetary funds at the central budget level. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  See above. 2.4.1 Valuation  Flows and stocks are largely based on market value, while projects are based on competitive bidding price. Foreign currency-denominated transactions on the other hand are converted into domestic currency using the foreign exchange rate determined by MOF at the time these transactions are made.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: All data are recorded on a modified cash basis. The financial statements of the Government are prepared in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) Financial Reporting, Financial Management Act 2004 and Finance Instructions 2010  Government Fiscal Year (FY) is from August to July.  In the data presentation, the monthly tab (Dataset_CY) comprises the following: · Annual calendar information from 2006 to 2014 and · Monthly data for 2015 up till 2022  The Quarterly tab (Dataset_FY) contains the following: · Annual Fiscal data for 2015 to 2017 and · Quarterly figures from FY 2017-2018 onwards.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical framework: The Funds Statement for Central Government Finances is prepared in the form of a cash flow statement. The basic structure of the statement is divided into descriptions of the cash flows within the Central Government’s own operations, transfer finances, capital expenditures and financing. Each section presents the sources and application of funding for that section in such a way that the end result is the cash flow (cash surplus/deficit) generated by the functions belonging to that section. The grand total of the cash flows of all the sections constitutes the change in liquid assets for the reporting period, which is shown on the bottom line of the statement. OWN OPERATIONS CASH FLOW Taxes and tax-like revenue total Service sales, rents, usage charges and other operating income Interest income and withdrawal of profit Purchase expenditure on goods and services Staff costs Other expenses Pensions paid Debt interest payments TRANSFER FINANCES CASH FLOW Transfer finance revenue Transfers in Finland and abroad INVESTMENTS CASH FLOW Investments in fixed assets Gains on the sale of fixed assets Investments in securities Capital gains on investments Loans granted Repayments of loans granted FINANCING CASH FLOW Net change in central government debt Net change in other debt CHANGE IN LIQUID ASSETS  The Balance Statement for Central Government Finances is presented in the form of the Funds Statement lines grouped into income, expenses, capital expenditures and debt.

60,60,61,GAB,Gabon,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The main frame of reference for the organization and compilation of data on central government operations is the government flow of funds table (TOFE), which is based on the construction and concepts recommended in ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"", IMF, 1986. The statistics are available to the general public upon request, quarterly and annually from the Inter-institutional Statistics Committee of the Ministry. Gabon's TOFE provides data on the following aggregates: Total revenue: Includes oil revenue (proportional resource royalty, profit tax, revenue from revenue sharing contracts, and government remuneration as a shareholder in the companies operating in the sector) and nonoil revenue (duties and taxes on international trade, direct taxes, indirect taxes, nontax revenue). Revenue from the nonoil sector constitutes special account revenue. This is a fraction of the revenue from import duties and taxes and VAT (value added tax), which is assigned to the special nonbudgeted accounts. However, total government revenue does not include social security contributions, which are managed by an autonomous agency, the National Social Security Fund (CNSS). Grants identified: The ""grant"" aggregate is often zero as grants are negligible in the case of Gabon, which does not benefit from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Total expenditure: This is subdivided into current expenditure and capital expenditure. Current expenditure covers the operations of central government and interest related to the public debt. Current expenditure data cover wages and salaries, procurement of goods and services, transfers and subsidies. Interest-domestic and external-is derived from outstanding service. Capital expenditure covers self-financed investment expenditure and ""finex"" (foreign financing through investment projects); Lending minus repayments; Primary balances, on a commitments basis and on a cash basis: the primary balance calculated is the difference between total revenue and primary expenditure (total expenditure excluding interest on the debt and ""finex""); the balance on a commitments basis is the difference between total revenue and total expenditure. The commitments basis is converted to a cash basis by adding changes in domestic and external arrears. The balance on a cash basis corresponds strictly to total financing, with the opposite sign. Since 2001, TOFE data have been compiled on a payment order basis; Total financing is broken down into net external financing and net domestic financing. Net external financing covers all operations related to the outstanding principal of the debt, changes in arrears on the principal, rescheduling and/or cancellation, and lastly, to external drawings for investment projects. Net domestic financing comprises bank financing (net BEAC and commercial bank financing) and nonbank financing (net oil advances, principal due on domestic debt subject to a moratorium, commercial agreements, asset transfers, transactions to become current, changes in correspondent accounts with the Treasury, and other cash operations, etc.). Data made available to the general public upon request are in the form of quarterly cumulative data. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The government flow of funds table (TOFE) covers all budgetary operations (or nonbudgeted transactions within the framework of the special nonbudgeted accounts) of the central government. The scope of this definition covers the offices of the president and vice-president of the republic, the offices of the prime minister and deputy prime minister, the parliament (senate and national assembly), the constitutional court, the national communications board, the economic and social council, and all the ministries. However, some government entities, such as the national social security fund (CNSS), the municipalities, and public enterprises, are excluded from the scope of the definition of central government.  The entire territory is covered. The TOFE covers all central government operations (as defined above) related to the budget and Treasury operations.  Unrecorded activity 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification system is close to the recommendations of “A Manual on Government Finance Statistics“ (GFSM), IMF, 1986. Even though total revenue is subdivided into oil revenue and nonoil revenue, total revenue can be presented by separating tax revenue from nontax revenue as oil and nonoil revenue are broken down by type. 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions in commodities are usually valued at market price at the time of the transaction. The exchange rates used to convert expenditure and revenue are effectively based on the market rates at the time of the transactions.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Revenue is recorded on a cash basis. The exchange rate to the dollar used for recording oil revenue is the market rate on the date of receipt. Operating and investment expenditure is recorded on a commitments basis. Public debt service is the actual service due and the scheduled service projected.",

Included are the fiscal data of central budgetary institutions, social security, and extra budgetary funds. Public corporations, public non-profit institutions and off-budget public fund (Media Fund) controlled by central government are out of the scope of fiscal data. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  National presentation of fiscal data are classified in accordance with the Annual Budget Law, which differs from GFS'2014 methodology, as repayment of policy loans and revenues from sale of equities are included in total revenues and lending for policy purposes and purchase of equities or capital injections are included in total expenditures. This national budgetary presentation does not cause deviation from the concept of overall balance on cash basis in GFS'2014. Reporting and accounting system of legal government units are regulated by the 2013 Government Decree No. 4/2013 (I.11) exhaustively identifies the classification systems. 2.4.1 Valuation  Prevailing market rates are used to convert foreign currency denominated transactions to forints.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Central government operations are recorded on a cash basis.

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2014 (GFSM 2014) 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Cash based data covers operations of the budgetary central government (BCG) and the social security system (SSF). The SSF is mostly financed by grants from the BCG and by social contributions collected by the BCG and transferred to SSF (transfers between these subsectors are consolidated).  Exceptions to coverage  Currently only covers budgetary units as we do not have high frequency data for extrabudgetary units. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification system: GFSM 2014 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: Transactions denominated in foreign currency are converted to ISK by using prevailing market rates.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Quarterly data on budgetary central government are on a mixed cash and accrual basis. The wages and salaries are centrally organized (managed) and are on an accrual basis. Similarly, most of the smallest institutions produce their monthly accounts on an accrual basis. The revenues and most of the other expenditures (not mentioned above) are, on the other hand, on a cash basis (this appplies, for example, to most of the larger budgetary units). The fiscal year is the same as the calendar year.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustment for grossing and netting of transactions: The transactions are mostly recorded on a gross basis. The sales of goods and services are compiled on a gross basis, but recorded and subtracted from expenses on the expenditure side. Financing is compiled on a gross basis, but recorded on a net basis, e.g. loans minus repayments, etc.",
75,75,76,IND,India,2014,2014,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  · Analytical framework: The accounting system is operated through three funds viz., (i) Consolidated Fund, (ii) Contingency Fund and (iii) Public Account. · All revenues received by Government, loans raised by it, and also its receipts from recoveries of loans granted by it, form the Consolidated Fund. All expenditure of Government is incurred from the Consolidated Fund and no amount can be withdrawn from the Fund without authorisation from Parliament. · Occasions may arise when Government may have to meet urgent unforeseen expenditure pending authorisation from Parliament. The Contingency Fund is an imprest placed at the disposal of the President to incur such expenditure. Parliamentary approval for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from Contingency Fund is subsequently obtained and the amount spent from Contingency Fund is recouped to the Fund. The corpus of the Fund authorised by the Parliament, at present, is Rs. 500 crore. · Besides the normal receipts and expenditure of Government which relate to the Consolidated Fund, certain other transactions enter Government accounts, in respect which, Government acts more as a banker, for example, transactions relating to provident funds, small savings collections, other deposits, etc. The moneys thus received are kept in the Public Account and the connected disbursements are also made therefrom. Generally speaking, Public Account funds do not belong to Government and have to be paid back some time or the other to the persons and authorities who deposited them. Parliamentary authorisation for payments from the Public Account, is therefore, not required. In a few cases, a part of the revenue of Government is set apart in separate funds for expenditure of specific objects like sugar development, replacement of depreciated assets of commercial undertakings, etc. These amounts are withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund with the approval of Parliament and kept in the Public Account for expenditure on the specific objects. The actual expenditure on the specific objects is, however, again submitted for vote of Parliament even though the moneys have already been earmarked by Parliament for transfer to the funds. The balances in all the three funds are maintained in a single unified account with the Reserve Bank of India ;"" the central bank of the country. · The accounts reflect three kinds of deficits, viz., Fiscal Deficit, Revenue Deficit and Primary Deficit. Fiscal Deficit is the difference between the Revenue Receipts plus non-debt Capital Receipts in the Consolidated Fund of India and the total non-debt expenditure in the Consolidated Fund of India including loans, net of repayments. This indicates the total borrowings of the Government from all sources. Fiscal Deficit fully corresponds to the overall deficit defined in the IMF; Government Finance Statistics Manual (2014). The Revenue Deficit refers to the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts. The Primary Deficit is measured by fiscal deficit less interest payments. · Government Accounting Rules, 1990 specifies the complete framework, concepts and definitions. [Copies can be obtained from the Controller of Publications, Civil Lines, Delhi-110054, India (Phone: 91 11 23819689 Fax: 91 11 23817846)]. · The Fiscal Deficit is the deficit concept which corresponds to the overall deficit defined in the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual and as reflected in the Budget Documents. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  · The data cover the operations of budgetary Central Government. The Provident Funds and Insurance funds of Central Government employees are not segregated from the funds of the Central Government. Such funds are maintained as a part of the Public Account.  Exceptions to coverage  Data on the operations of the extra budgetary funds and social security funds are not included. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  · Classification system: The accounts are classified in terms of revenue and capital sections. 2.4.1 Valuation  · Loans, borrowing, deposits, advances, etc. are at book value and are not marked to market.· The external debt transactions are valued at the current exchange rate as determined by RBI from time to time.· Primarily the accounts are maintained on a cash basis. However, certain year-end adjustments on account of interest on various reserve and other funds maintained in the Public Accounts, contributions to / withdrawals from such funds are accounted for on accrual basis.",

The major economic aggregates include total revenue, expense, net operating balance, net landing/borrowing, net acquisition of non -financial and financial assets and net incurrence in liabilities. Revenue side consists of taxes, social contributions, grants and other revenue. The expense side consists of compensation of employees, use of goods and services, consumption of fixed capital, interest, subsidies, grants, social benefits and other expense. The data on financial assets and liabilities are broken down into domestic and foreign. Relationship with international guidelines: The data are based on the GFSM2014 guidelines. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Central government operations data cover the budgetary and extra-budgetary central government units and the National Insurance Institute and are broken down according to GFSM 2014 classification. 2.4.1 Valuation  For domestic transactions, such as purchases of goods and services and GFCF, market prices are generally used. Compensation of employees includes actual payments of wages and salaries plus actual and imputed employer's contributions for funded and unfunded pension funds and for other social schemes. Valuation of foreign currency transactions: The conversion of foreign-currency-denominated transactions is made using the representative market exchange rates.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The central government accounts are, to the extent possible, based on the accrual recording of transactions, including the gross fixed capital formation, the consumption of fixed capital and imputed government pension contributions, both of which are estimated on an accrual basis. Different timing characteristics of the cash flows for the different types of taxes are taken into account, as necessary. Other central government data, such as interest and compensation of employees, are largely compiled on an accrual basis.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Government transactions are compiled on a gross basis for revenue and expense for all sub-sectors of the central government. Acquisitions and disposals of non-financial and financial assets are presented net. Tax data are shown on net basis (after deduction of refunds).",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) disseminates quarterly data on central government operations in its quarterly ""Economic Update and Outlook"" and on its website. The data are largely consistent with the recommendations of the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" (""GFSM""), 1986. The analytical framework is presented in the following format: Revenue and Grants Tax revenue Non-tax revenue Bauxite levy Capital revenue Grants Expenditure Recurrent expenditure Programmes Wages and salaries Interest Domestic External Capital expenditure Capital Programmes IMF#1 A/C Statistical Discrepancy Fiscal balance (Surplus + /Deficit -) Loan receipts Domestic External Divestment proceeds Amortization Domestic External Overall Balance (Surplus + /Deficit -) Revenue consists of nonrepayable receipts in the form of taxes and various nontax inflows. Repayment of loans made by government is included in capital revenue, as is sales of land and fixed assets. Expenditure includes all non-repayable outlays of government for current and capital purposes, except that capital expenditure includes loans made by government. The fiscal balance is derived from financing transactions (below the line). ""Statistical Discrepancy"" is a discrepancy that arises from the fact that deficit determining transactions are derived from the accounts of the AGD, while financing transactions are compiled by the BOJ from its accounts, reports of commercial banks, and AGD data. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The institutional coverage of the data comprises only Ministries and Departments covered by the government's budgetary accounts. Central government units that operate with their own budgets include the National Insurance Fund, the Capital Development Fund, the Human Employment and Resources Training Trust (HEART), the National Housing Trust, and statutory bodies and agencies. Annual data for most extrabudgetary agencies is provided in the budget publication ""Jamaica, Public Sector Entities"", published by the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Transfers to extrabudgetary units and local governments are included in the data for budgetary accounts. The accounts of the central government include the operations of the postal services. The current and capital accounts of this enterprise are included in the accounts of central government on a gross basis. Local government in Jamaica consists of the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC) and 13 parish councils. No data on local governments are regularly disseminated and there is no consolidation of central and local governments to produce general government data. However, about 90% of total local government resources are provided by the central government budget. All transactions of Ministries and Departments--revenue, expenditure, lending and financing--are included in the data. Exceptions to coverage  The operations of extrabudgetary agencies are not included. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Revenue is classified as tax and non-tax, with taxes broken down by: taxes on income and profits, taxes on production and consumption, and taxes on international trade. The only detailed expenditure classification is found in the budget document. A functional classification divides expenditure into 26 categories. The detail provided permits reconciliation with the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) recommended in the ""1993 System of National Accounts"" and in the ""Manual on Government Finance Statistics"". 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in local currency at the actual transaction exchange rate on the date the transaction was effected.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Central government operations are recorded on a cash basis. Revenue is recorded when a cheque or cash is received and expenditure is recorded when cheques are cleared and cash disbursed. There is no complementary period and no additional transactions are recorded in the accounts after the close of the fiscal year.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  A statement of consolidated central government operations is currently compiled, but is not disseminated.

This framework is based on the methodology prescribed in A manual on Government Finance Statistics Government Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSManual 2001): Cash receipts from operating activities with a breakdown by taxes, social contribution, grants and other receipts. Cash payments for operating activities with breakdown by compensation of employees, purchase of goods and services , interest, subsidies ,grants, social benefits and other payments Nt cash outflows from investments in nonfinancial assets with breakdown by purchase of nonfinancial assets and sales of nonfinancial assets Financing data are on a cash basis Net incurrence of liabilities with breakdown by domestic and foreign Financing data are on a cash basis, and should correspond to the overall cash deficit/surplus. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  According to GFS Manual2001, GFS should be compiled for the general government sector, and its sub sectors. In Jordan, GFS cover the central government operations which include (budgetary, Part of own- budget agencies and social security corporation ) budgetary data is disseminated monthly but own- budget and social security corporation are disseminated yearly, these data represent around 90 percent of the consolidated general government's operations; thus, the data are broadly adequate for fiscal analysis.

85,85,86,KAZ,Kazakhstan,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical Framework and Concepts: The methodology for compiling these data is broadly consistent with the analytical framework set out in the IMF's Manual on Government Finance Statistics (MGFS) 1986. Concepts, definitions, and classification structures used in compiling these data follow in general the corresponding provisions of the MGFS, except that repayment of loans is included in receipts along with revenues and official transfers received, rather than being netted against lending. Relationship with international guidelines: The national data definitions for fiscal aggregates disseminated under the SDDS correspond to the definitions in MGFS 1986. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Institutional coverage of central government in reported data: The Republican budget includes all data on the operations of Central Government. Considering that since January 1999 all extrabudgetary operations have been included in the budget, such scope is equivalent to the consolidated data for the Central Government. The data include foreign grants, as well until July 1, 2006 they include the operations related to the creation of the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Since 1999 receipts of the extrabudgetary funds have been recorded as a part of the social tax, royalties, excise tax on gasoline and tolls for the passage of motor vehicles through the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established by Decree No. 402 of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan of August 23, 2000 “On the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan.” A significant proportion of the Fund’s revenues are generated from payments to the budget from organizations in the raw materials sector (legal entities based on a list established by the Republic of Kazakhstan government) in excess of the budget revenue target. In addition, there are other revenues, including proceeds from the privatization of state property under republican ownership in the mining, extraction, and manufacturing sectors of the economy and payments under production-sharing agreements, as well as proceeds from the sale of agricultural land by the state to private owners, and official transfers received from the republican budget. On the other hand, National Fund resources may be used to make up for republican budget shortfalls, defined as the difference between scheduled and actual republican budget receipts from organizations in the raw materials sector as a whole for the current fiscal year  Exceptions to coverage  The institutional scope excludes the operation of National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan that was establish in May 2001. Also, from July 1, 2006 the data do not include the budget revenue allocated to the National Fund, as determined by budget law, and their transfer to the account of the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan that was opened to account for the money of the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification System: Pursuant to the budget legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Uniform Budget Classification is a regulatory legal document which sets out the grouping of receipts of the budget and expenditures from the budget by functional, departmental and economic characteristics. The Uniform Budget Classification is established by the agency competent for budget planning. The classification is broadly consistent with the MGFS 1986. The budget structure consists of: receipts: revenue, official transfers received, repayment of loans. expenditures: expenses, loans. budget deficit (surplus) financing of the budget deficit (use of the surplus). Receipts of the budget include: (1) tax receipts classified by the type of taxes, fees and other compulsory payments; (2) nontax receipts classified by the type of revenue, fees and payments, receipts from penalties and fines, remuneration (interest) on loans; (3) revenue from operations with capital, classified by the type of sold property and other government assets; (4) official transfers received – unrequited and non-repayable receipts of the budget except grants; (5) repayment of loans – amount of repaid principal debt on loans previously paid out of the budget broken down into repayment of domestic loans, repayment of claims based on paid government guarantees, sales of stock owned by the government outside of the country and repayment of external loans. The classification of budget revenue has four levels of subdivision: category, class, subclass and specific feature. A combination of these levels forms the budget revenue classification code which classifies every type of revenue. Expenditures are classified on two basic parameters: the purpose or function to whose fulfillment the expenditures are bound, and the economic characteristics of operations whose implementation produces these expenditures. Accordingly, functional and economic classifications are distinguished. Also used is the institutional parameter which serves as a basis for estimating the execution of budget expenditures broken down by the administrator of budget programs (departmental classification). Reports on the execution of the expenditure part of budget are compiled according to the functional, economic and departmental classifications. The functional classification of budget expenditures has five levels of subdivision: functional group, subfunction, administrator of budget programs, program, subprogram. A combination of these levels forms the code of functional budget expenditure classification. The economic classification of expenditures has four vertical levels: category, class, subclass and specific item. The execution of budget expenditures by departmental classification represents a grouping of expenses and loans by administrator of budget programs. A combination of economic and functional classification in the form of a cross-classification which includes the principal categories of both of the aforementioned classifications is used in the process of executing the budget. Budget deficit is created when the volume of expenditures exceeds the total amount of receipts of the budget and is recorded with the sign “minus,” and when the total amount of receipts of the budget exceeds the volume of expenditures it creates a budget surplus and is recorded with the sign “plus.” Financing of the budget deficit is defined as a process of attracting funds through the privatization of state property, borrowing and sale of government-issued securities on a formal securities market with the goal of using these funds and the balances of budget funds for the repayment of principal debt, purchase of government-issued securities on a formal securities market, covering the budget deficit and generating spare balances of budget funds for the purpose of managing debt. Financing is classified according to GFSM by the type of creditor and by the type of debt instrument further broken down into domestic, which includes receipts from privatization of state property, and external. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: Receipt and payment operations performed with the external government loans are recorded in the republican and local budgets in tenge, using the exchange rate established by the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan as of the date the transaction was performed.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: Republican budget operations, with the exception of receipts and payments made out of government external loans, are recorded on a cash basis through the Single Treasury Account (STA). Expenditures are recorded at the moment when the STA is debited, and revenues are recorded when the STA is credited. Operations involving receipts and payments made out of government external loans are recorded on the basis of monthly reports on the receipt and disbursement of funds from government external loans. The time of recording approximates as much as possible the time of payment based on the cash method. The data on borrowing are recorded on the date of withdrawal of funds from the creditors’ accounts. The data on the settlement and servicing of debt are recorded on the date of crediting the funds to the creditor’s account. No adjustments for the conversion of data to the cash method are required because no data are recorded using the accrual method. Complementary period: There is an accounting period – a period not included in the new financial year, during which final operations are conducted with approved budget expenditures for investment projects for which financing was not secured in the concluded financial year, and with crediting official transfers to budgets. The accounting period for the previous year’s budget is concluded on March 15 of the current year.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustment for grossing and netting of transactions: The data are recorded on a gross basis. Revenue and expenditure repayments are considered adjustment transactions and are subtracted from the appropriate category of revenue or expenditure, depending on the circumstances. Taxes paid by spending agencies are not excluded from the data on revenue.",
86,86,87,KEN,Kenya,2001,2001,2001,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Government data covers cash flow operations of central government unit covering the recurrent and the development budgets and units with claims on the Exchequer. Units funded by employees are not included. Fiscal data closely follow the recommendations of the 1986 GFSM. Detailed classifications of revenue and expenditure are available. Revenue, expenditure, balance, and financing with breakdowns (debt holder, instrument), as relevant.  Investment income includes dividend payments to the Government from public owned enterprises, equity in private enterprises. Other Revenue includes fines, traffic revenue, aviation revenue, land revenue, etc. Grants in cash imply funds that are received by the ex-chequer while grant Appropriations-in-Aid (A-in-A) are funds disbursed directly to the spending agency. Pensions item includes salaries of constitutional offices e.g., Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK), Public service Commission (PSC). Other expenditure includes Operations and Maintenance and defense related expenditure. Development expenditure is disaggregated into domestically financed and foreign financed. The net lending/borrowing is computed as sum of equity purchased by Government and loans given to public enterprises less loan repayments by the same.  The data are presented in the following framework TOTAL REVENUE, including Grants Revenue Ordinary Revenue Income Tax Value Added Tax (VAT) Import duty (net) Excise duty Investment Income Other Revenue Appropriations in Aid (A-in-A) Grants Cash Appropriations in Aid EXPENDITURE AND NET LENDING Recurrent expenditure Wages and salaries Interest payments Domestic financing Foreign interest due Pensions Others Development & Net lending Development Projects Foreign Financed Payment of guaranteed loans Changes in pending bills (local) DEFICITS Deficit excluding grants (commitment basis) Grants Deficit including grants (commitment basis) Adjustment to cash basis Deficit including Grants (Cash basis) FINANCING Net Foreign Financing Disbursements Programme cash loans Project Cash loans Project Loans A-in-A Repayment due (current) Rescheduling Change in arrears (current) Repayment (arrears) Privatisation proceeds Net Domestic Financing IMF PRGF CBK Commercial banks Non banks  The fiscal year for the central government recurrent and development budgets is July to June. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Only budget operations that are covered under GoK funding are covered through internal Ministries’ accounting and expenditure control systems (at least on a monthly basis). However Development Budget transactions covered by external funds (direct funding) have longer lags, depending on the efficiency of the relevant disbursement and reporting agency (donor)- usually more than a month. The coverage and accuracy improves with the length of reporting time (e.g. annual, quarterly etc). Pending bills is also a new phenomenon that creates discrepancies between actual budget estimates and implemented budget execution at a particular point in time. Central Government data covers the entire Republic of Kenya. Central Government Operations Central Government data covers all Ministries' financial operations, in form of budgets (Recurrent and development Estimates, Revised estimates, Appropriations Accounts, Monthly Budget out-turns) etc. In addition to the regular Ministries, the reports include Commissions, autonomous government agencies, with a claim on exchequer funding. However the central Government accounts do not cover these autonomous units, except transfers to these units. Others funded by employees (e.g. NSSF, NHIF and local authorities) are not included. Local Government operations (encouraged extensions) Besides the Central Government, there are 174 local authorities, each with an independent budgeting system. By law their budgets have to be audited and endorsed by the Ministry of Local Government. Many of these local authorities lack conventional accounting units and capacity, hence no standard budgets are prepared. Data for local authorities are disseminated in the public finance chapter of the KNBS Economic Survey. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  MOPND's Central government operations analytical tables include a summarized classification for all major aggregates. In the analytical table, revenue is classified into main tax categories while non-tax revenue identifies social contributions, property income, Fines penalties and forfeitures, Sale of goods and services repayment from domestic lending and on lending, and other unclassified revenues collected by the MOF, Ministries and other state agencies. Revenue is classified as:  Taxes on incomes and capital gains Income tax from individuals (PAYE) Income tax from corporations Taxes on property Immovable property Financial and capital transactions Taxes on goods and services VAT VAT on domestic goods and services VAT on imported goods and services  Excise duties Taxes on specific services Fees on use of goods and on permission to use goods or to perform services and activities Royalties Taxes on goods and services collected as AIA Other taxes on goods and services Taxes on International Trade & Transactions Custom Duties Other taxes on international Trade &Transactions Other taxes not elsewhere classified Social security contributions Property income Sale of goods and services Fines penalties and forfeitures Repayment from domestic lending and on lending  Classification of functions of Government (COFOG) is presented as follows: General public Services Public debt Transactions Transfers of General character between levels of government Defense Public order and safety Economic affairs General economic, commercial and labour affairs Agriculture, forestry Fishing and hunting  Fuel and energy Mining, manufacturing and construction Transport Communication Other industries Environmental protection Housing and Community amenities Health Outpatient services Hospital services Public health services Health expenditure not else where classified Recreation, culture and religion Education Administration Pre-primary and primary education Secondary education\ Tertiary education Education not elsewhere classified. Social Protection  The economic classification of expenditure is presented as follows: Expense Consumption expenditure on goods and services. Compensation of Employment Use of goods and services Interest: Foreign Domestic Subsidies: Grants to International organizations Foreign Government General government units Social benefits Other expense. Total Current expenditure Capital Grants (Transfers) Total expense Acquisition of Non-Financial assets(net) Building and structures Machinery and equipment Inventories Valuables Non produced assets Less disposal of Non- financial assets Public debt redemption Total expenditure Government expenditure is first disaggregated into recurrent and development expenditure based on the budget. Although all recurrent expenditure is synonymous to current expenditure, some current expenditure may be included in the development vote. Typical examples are where donor funds entered under development expenditure, are utilized to pay recurrent expenditures like salaries and other operation and maintenance activities. For economic classification of expenditure, Expense distinguishes compensation of employees, use of goods and services, Subsidies, interest, Current grants and capital grants. Acquisition of Non-Financial assets constitutes building and structures, Plant and machinery, inventories, Valuables and non- produced assets. Economic analysis of expenditures by main services is done for each ministry or department using the recommendations of the UN for the analysis of Government accounts. The 4-digit ISIC codes are used to give a useful breakdown of economic activities by main services. Financing is classified broadly into domestic and external. Foreign financing shows total disbursements and amortization: Domestic financing is classified into long term-net and short term-net borrowing. Public debt redemption is captured as a memorandum item, and categorized into external and internal payments. The summary for the entire government expenditure is compiled and is used to in the compilation of Producer of Government Services of the national accounts. Local Authorities Reforms have been initiated in the accounting procedures of local authorities with the goal to consolidate the accounts and standardize the accounting and reporting approaches (formulate a standard budgeting and reporting manual). Local authorities account to the Ministry of Local Government on the transfers from the Central Government under what is known as the Local Authority Transfer Fund (LATF). The KNBS obtains from the Ministry of Local Government annual data on the operations of local authorities, which is then summarized in the annual Economic Survey. The Central Government also pays for Guaranteed Loans of all public enterprises and local authorities with liquidity problems. Local authorities’ data is disseminated in the public finance chapter of the KNBS Economic Survey. The expenditure of local authorities is presented by economic classification (current and capital expenditure) and on main services (administration, community, social and economic services). Supplemental information for internal use: On a weekly basis the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) submits a table detailing the actual collection of the major tax revenue by type, to the Economic Affairs Department for use in preparing the monthly update of the Budget Out-turn table. The EAD prepares a detailed budget out-turn on a monthly basis based on revenues received at the exchequer, expenditure returns from all the ministries, financing data from the External Resources department, Debt Management Department (DMD) and the Central Bank (CBK). The same data, on a quarterly basis, is presented in the EAD's Quarterly Economic and Budgetary Review (QEBR), which contains central government operational tables, plus more detailed revenue and expenditure tables. 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions in foreign currency are converted according to the daily rates supplied by the CBK at the time of the transaction  2.4.2 Recording basis  Time of Recording Revenue is recorded on a cash basis. Tax revenue is recorded when collections are made by the KRA. Other non-tax revenues are recorded when cash or cheques are deposited with the receiving government agent or agency, KRA or the CBK. Expenditure is largely recorded on a commitment basis. In the case of grants and loans in kind to development projects, the development expenditures are recorded when goods and services are received Closing of Accounts All the central Government's accounts are closed at the end of the financial year (30th June) and this implies that no more cheques are written for that year's accounts. The outstanding exchequer issues at this point cease to have any effect.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  All transactions are recorded on a gross basis, except for tax refunds which are netted against revenue",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical framework and concepts:  The central government operations data are organized for analytical purposes using the system of definitions and classifications prescribed in a Manual on Government Finance Statistics, IMF, 1986 (GFSM). The data are compiled in accordance with the methodology set out in the IMF's A Manual on Government Finance Statistics. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Institutional coverage of central government in reported data: The central government operations data cover the consolidated central government i.e., all the budgetary units of the central government (ministries, their branches, and agencies, and the social security funds) and the extra-budgetary funds managed by these units. The accounts of the central government are comprised of the general account, special accounts, extrabudgetary funds (including social security funds) and off-budget items. Extrabudgetary funds include social security funds such as National Pension Fund. The special accounts regarding the nonfinancial public enterprises are not included in the government operations data described in this metadata. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification system:  Revenue is classified as current revenue (tax revenue, social security contribution, and nontax revenue) and capital revenue in accordance with the GFSM. Expenditure is composed of current expenditure (with interest payments separately identified), capital expenditure, and net lending, and classified by function and by economic characteristics. Data on financing are broken down into foreign financing, and domestic financing, with domestic financing further broken down by type of debt instrument into loans, bonds and other domestic financing. The net (deficit/surplus) of revenues and expenditures is equal to financing transaction of the central government. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Korean currency at the prevailing market exchange rate.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: Statistics are compiled on the basis of cash accounting with exceptional application of modified cash accounting for some receipts and disbursements. Complementary period is 15 days after the end of the reference year.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustment for grossing and netting of transactions: All the data are accounted on a gross basis.",

90,90,91,KWT,Kuwait,2001,2001,2001,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Kuwait fiscal data are presented in three separate sets of accounts. The Central Government Budgetary Accounts cover the activities of central government ministries and departments; the Attached Budgets encompass the operations of those agencies which render government-type services but have limited self-revenue services and, in lieu of the authority to borrow independently, are dependent on central government subsidies to finance their operations; and the Independent Budgets cover the activities of agencies which generally are profit making and required to remit a predetermined share of these profits directly to the General Reserve Fund, which is separately managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), and are authorized to retain the rest for self-investment. The Central Government Budgetary Accounts depart from the statistical framework set out in the IMF ""Government Finance Statistics Manual, 1986"" (""GFS Manual"") in several important respects (see also Scope of the Data below): First, the operations of several agencies which market goods and services on a large scale to the general public (such as the post office) are presented on a gross basis rather than net. Second, with the exception of interest payments on nonnegotiable bonds issued to domestic banks in 1992 (see the comprehensive framework for Central Government debt) which are included in Chapter 5 of Central Government Budgetary expenditure, interest and amortization payments with respect to government debt are effected by the KIA and are not directly included in Central Government Budgetary Accounts. Third, net lending including the significant item of earnings on government investments are included in KIA operations and similarly excluded from Central Government accounts. Fourth, by Law 106 of 1976, ten percent of all revenues are assigned to the Reserve Fund for Future Generations managed by the KIA and classified as a central government budgetary allocation to be added to expenditure. Finally, the Central Government Budgetary accounts provide no details of budgetary financing as the KIA is required by law to finance any deficit by drawing down resources from the General Reserve Fund which it manages. In general, Revenues in the Central Budgetary Accounts comprise nonrepayable government receipts and Expenditures encompass government nonfinancial obligations, as defined in the ""GFS Manual"". 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Except for interest payments related to the government assumption of private sector nonperforming loans through the issuance of nonnegotiable long-term bonds (the Difficult Debt Settlement bonds), which are included, the budgetary accounts exclude all interest payments with respect to government debt, as they are netted from earnings on government investments managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority. Central Government activities are generally classified in three separate sets of accounts: Central Government Budgetary Accounts; Attached Budgets (also known as Extrabudgetary Units of Attached Budgets), and Independent Budgets (also known as Extrabudgetary Units of Independent Budgets). The Central Government Budgetary data cover the activities of central government ministries and departments, as well as the gross transactions of several agencies that market goods and services to the general public on a large scale and that the IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual would include only on a net basis. Examples of these agencies are the Postal Service, the Ministry of Water and Electricity, the Public Authority for Housing Care and the Ministry of Communications. The administrative costs of the KIA are included in Central Budgetary Accounts, but its commercial activities are excluded. The fifth expenditure chapter of the Central Government Budget also includes: 1) transfers to 16 loss-making agencies such as Kuwait University and Kuwait Municipality covered in the Attached Accounts, 2) transfers to 4 agencies such as the Kuwait Research Agency which are included in the Independent Budgets, and 3) interest payments with respect to bad private sector debts assumed by the government (see below). The Attached Budgets encompass the operations of those agencies which render government-type services but have meager resources and are not authorized to borrow independently; they are thus dependent on government subsidies to finance their operations. With the four exceptions noted above, the Independent Budgets document the activities of agencies which are self-financing, such as the Central Bank of Kuwait and the Public Institution for Social Security, which receives transfers from the central government budget with respect to the Government contribution on behalf of its employees but maintains its accounts separate from the central government accounts. The central government budgetary data depart from the recommendations of the IMF ""Government Finance Statistics Manual, 1986"" (""GFS Manual"") in several important ways: i. First, the accounts of several agencies such as the post office which market goods and services on a large scale to the general public are presented on a gross rather than net basis. ii. Second, the exclusion of commercial activities of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), which is responsible for managing the General Reserve Fund (GRF), from the central government budget accounts creates several departures from GFS conventions. The earnings from existing assets and new loans from GRF assets are not included as net lending in the central government accounts, nor are interest payments with respect to foreign and most domestic debt (however, interest payments with respect to nonnegotiable bonds issued in 1992 to assume private sector nonperforming bank loans are included in Chapter Five of central government expenditure), which are internally netted from GRF earnings. iii. Moreover, the budgetary accounts include as an allocation to be added to expenditure the 10 percent of revenues which are by law 106 of 1976 allocated to the Reserve Fund for Future Generations, which is also managed by the KIA. In the absence of complete revenue and expenditure data, it is impossible to identify the central government budgetary balance as defined by the GFS, and hence the exact level of financing. In the Kuwaiti budgetary system any financing not provided by other sources is by law provided from the GRF. Central Government budgetary data are denominated in millions of Kuwaiti dinars, compiled on a cash basis, and encompass the operations of 26 ministries, departments, and other agencies. Revenue data are provided in eight chapters (see Section I of the Central Government Comprehensive Framework) and expenditure data in five. The fifth expenditure chapter contains over half of all central government expenditure, recording transfers to other government agencies, the interest on government non-negotiable bonds (see above), and oil revenues, which typically comprise from seventy-five to eighty percent of all government revenues. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The revenue data are provided in eight chapters, which are from oil, income and profits taxes, taxes and fees on properties, taxes and fees on commodities & services, taxes and fees on international trade, services, miscellaneous, and capital. The proportional contributions of each source vary significantly according to the price for oil, but usually oil revenues account for about seventy five to eighty percent of all budgetary revenue. The five expenditure chapters in the budget are for wages & salaries, commodity purchases, transport and equipment and service procurement, construction projects & public acquisitions, and other expenditures and transfers. The last category includes payments with respect to extrabudgetary items (see Scope of the Data) and interest on bad private sector debt assumed by the government under the ""Difficult Debt Settlement"" program and comprises about half of all budgetary outlays. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Data for central government transactions are recorded on a cash basis, but information on expenditure obligations is maintained for internal use. At the end of the fiscal year the accounts are held open for thirty days to allow final clearance of outstanding payments, but no new cash transactions are included during this period.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The presentation of the Comprehensive Treasury Operations (OGT) is based on the analytical framework of the Government Finance Statistics Manual (2001 edition). The General Directorate of the Treasury of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Budget is responsible for preparing data on central government aggregates and operations. The aggregates are expressed in billions of Malagasy francs. They describe only operations of the State, and the data pertain to execution of the budget law (use of previously verified accounting data from the main revenue offices), with the exception of expenditure (operating and investment) that is externally financed (program grants, subsidies, loans), which are provided by statistical sources from other general directorates of the Ministry. The operations of the various agencies of the central government–ODAC (including the National Social Security Fund) and local governments are not reflected. The OGT, however, presents the cash balances of these units of government (with the exception of the National Social Security Fund–CNAPS) as Treasury correspondent accounts. Revenue, personnel expenditure, interest on debt, and externally financed capital expenditure are recorded on a cash basis. Domestically financed operating expenditure and capital expenditure are recorded on a commitment basis. The overall balance is shown on a commitment basis and on an accrual basis. Financing operations are presented by type of claim and by source of the claim (domestic/external). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage: Social security contributions collected by the two civil service retirement funds (which are special Treasury accounts) and social security benefits paid are not itemized.

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The execution of government financial operations and the production of government finance statistics are governed by Order 78-011 of January 19, 1978 on the organic law for the budget law, by subsequent amendments for this order, and by Order 89-102 of January 23, 1989 on the general regulation for government accounting. These orders are supplemented by the provisions in the annual budget laws. Law 78-011 of January 19, 1978 was repealed and superseded by Law No. 039 of October 9, 2018. Domestically funded current and capital expenditure is monitored by the Ministry of Finance (MF), while externally funded current and capital expenditure is monitored by the Ministry of the Economy and Industry (MEI). Each month the General Directorate of the Treasury and Government Accounting (DGTCP) in the MF prepares the fiscal reporting table (TOFE), which presents central government revenue and expenditures as well as financing operations. The data in the TOFE and other tables are presented for analytical purposes based on the definitions and classifications of the 2001 edition of the Government Finance and Statistics Manual (MFSP 2001). The General Directorate of the Treasury and Government Accounting (DGTCP) in the MF prepares the government accounting system (BEIT ELMAAL) and the budgetary expenditure management system (RACHAD) for the periodic statements of revenue and charges including domestically funded current expenditure. The MEI prepares monthly statements of disbursement requests as part of externally funded current expenditure. Each year the MEI publishes a report on the physical and financial execution of the consolidated investment budget (domestically and externally funded capital expenditure). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction coverage: All revenue and expenditure (current and capital) of the units covered also appear in the TOFE. Geographic coverage: all the operations of units in Mauritania and those that meet the preceding definitions in the TOFE. We consider that the embassies and national missions abroad are located in Mauritania. Unit coverage: the TOFE is currently limited to the units covered by the government budget, to similar ministries and institutions, and to the special Treasury accounts. The DGTCP in the Ministry of Finance constructs the Table of Government Financial Operations (TOFE) each month, mainly in cooperation with the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) and the DGIPCE. The structure of the TOFE is as follows: Total revenue and grants (including oil revenue) Tax revenue (nonoil) Nontax revenue (including capital revenue) Grants Oil revenue Total charges (based on liability) Operating expenditure Current expenditure, incoming equity and net loans Fiscal balance Financing Domestic External Nonrecurring financing: resources generated by debts canceled under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The monetary unit used is billions of ouguiyas. Sources of statistics: The DGTCP in the MF for revenue and domestically funded operating expenditure and investment; the MEI externally funded investment expenditure. Financing data are obtained from the following entities: the BCM and the General Directorate of Public Investments and Economic Cooperation (DGIPCE).  Unrecorded activity  Operations of government administrative agencies, the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) and local governments (communes and regional councils) are not recorded in the TOFE. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification of government budget revenue and expenditure is established by Order 560/MF/98 of August 30, 1998. Revenue is broken down, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1986 GFSM, in tax revenue, nontax revenue, and capital revenue. Tax revenue is classified by tax base, and nontax revenue is classified by type. Expenditure is broken down, by economic type into operating expenditure (including debt interest), capital expenditure, equity, and net loans. The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is not currently in use. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Revenue is recorded on a cash basis, while expenditure is recorded on a commitment or payment authorization (accrual) basis. At the end of the fiscal year, a complementary period is opened, to run to March 31 of the following year, to allow for the settlement of authorized payments pending at December 31 and committals issued during the period.The settlement of government debts originating in previous fiscal years gives rise to the presentation of a budgetary cash balance (a cash-basis balance) for the ongoing fiscal year, after deduction of the outstanding balances (payment arrears) of expenditure for which payment has been authorized.",

Data on local governments cover operations of 21 aimags (provinces) and the capital city Ulaanbaatar. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification system underlying annual and monthly cumulative data corresponds broadly to the classification structures of the ""GFSM."" Tax revenue are disaggregated into income tax, social security contributions, property taxes, domestic taxes on goods and services (value added tax, excise taxes, and other), taxes on foreign trade, and other taxes. Annual general government expenditure and cumulative monthly expenditure of the general, central, and local governments are available classified by economic type (current expenditure are disaggregated by wages and salaries, employer contributions, other purchases of goods and services, interest payments, and subsidies and other transfers; capital expenditure are disaggregated by investment, capital repairs, road fund expenditure, and geologic exploration expenditure). In addition, annual general government expenditure published in the ""Mongolian Statistical Yearbook"" are disaggregated by function, broadly according to the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG). However, expenditure on defense and on public order and safety are indistinguishably included in the general public services function. 2.4.1 Valuation  Receipts and payments in foreign currency, such as foreign grants, borrowing, and amortization, are converted into togrog equivalents using the market exchange rate (Bank of Mongolia exchange rate) prevailing at the date on which the transaction was made.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: The operations of the central government are recorded on a cash basis. Expenditures are recorded when the checks are paid or cash is withdrawn from the treasury bank account, and revenues are recorded when the treasury bank account is credited. Grants in kind are not included. Same accounting basis applies to the data on local and general government operations. Complementary period: There is no complementary period for cash transactions. Non cash transactions are completed before submitting the annual reports to the Great Hural (Parliament).  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  General government data consolidate operations of the central and local government levels.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  All the reported data has been transformed and is presented in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2014) guidelines for cash data. The data has been reported in line with the requirements of data compilation and dissemination procedures, tables and statements are being reported. Tables are revenue, expense, transaction in assets and liabilities and statements are Statement of government Operation and Statement of sources and Uses of Cash both disseminated annually and published in Government Finance Statistics yearbook. The Statement of Government Operations is only submitted to the IMF annually for publication in the GFS Yearbook. No balance sheet or the other economic flows statements are published. The MFPE compiles data on government operations from government ministries and government administrative records. All transactions are measured on cash basis. In recent years, authorities have undertaken the responsibility of moving towards classification according to the (GFSM 2014), and reclassification has been implemented through a bridge table between national chart of accounts and GFS classifications for monthly/ quarterly budgetary central government and annual data. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Namibian government accounts, as presented in the MFPE's annual ""Budget Statement for the Financial Year"" and ""Estimate of Revenue and Expenditure for the Financial Year"", cover only the activities of budgetary central government. All transactions of the budgetary central government should be included in its reporting, but some foreign-financed development project expenditures (generally for smaller projects) are not included as part of Namibia's development spending. Sources of funding of development expenditure, as shown in the annual development budget - the Three-Year Rolling Development Budget for the Financial Year - are broken down between internal and external funding. According to the Three-Year Rolling Development Budget for the Financial Year, internal funding includes only resources financed by the government. External funding corresponds to financial resources provided by external funding agencies. This source of funding can be either in grant or loan form. External grants are channelled inside or outside the State Revenue Fund, while the external loans are supposed to be channelled through the State Revenue Fund. However, this is not yet fully realized. Therefore, substantial portions of external grants and external loans may be channelled outside the State Revenue Fund and thus would not be included in the accounts of budgetary central government.  Coverage: Namibian government accounts, as presented in the MFPE's annual ""Budget Statement for the Financial Year"" and ""Estimate of Revenue and Expenditure for the Financial Year"" for the Fiscal Year encompass the central government ministries which, together with other government agencies and offices are presented fewer than 35 votes. These data exclude operations of (a) the extra budgetary accounts and funds and (b) the Social Security Commission. Namibia is a unitary state with devolution of powers and functions implemented under the decentralization policy. State government (Regional Councils) and local governments (municipalities) have their own separate budgets, but they largely depend on budgetary transfers from budgetary central government.  Exceptions to coverage  The budgetary central government operations data reported only cover budgetary administrative records not including Extra-budgetary units. The monthly and quarterly budgetary central government operation data compilation does not include extra-budgetary units and social security funds, these are only reported as part of the general government operations on an annual basis. Plan to cover extra-budgetary units in future.  Unrecorded activity  Data are all recorded and if unrecorded activity is detected it will immediately be investigated. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The budget classification is being reviewed and aligned to GFSM 2014 codes, and this new classification will be implemented in the Chart of Accounts. 1 Revenue  11 Taxes 12 Social contributions  13 Grants  14 Other revenue  2 Expense  21 Compensation of employees  22 Uses of goods and services  24 Interest  25 Subsidies  26 Grants  27 Social benefits  28 Other expense  GOB Gross operating balance  31 Net/gross investment in nonfinancial assets  311 Fixed assets  312 Inventories  313 Valuables  314 Nonproduced assets  2M Expenditure (2+31)  NLB Net lending (+) / net borrowing (-) ( 1-2-31) or (1-2M)  32 Net acquisition of financial assets  321 Domestic debtors  322 External debtors  33 Net incurrence of liabilities  331 Domestic creditors  332 External creditors  NLBz Overall statistical discrepancy  MFPE compiles data on government operations from administrative records.

In recent years, authorities have classified data according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2014 – through a bridge table that links national codes to GFS classifications 2.4.1 Valuation  State Account through treasury authorities provide accounting and reporting in national currency Namibian dollar (N$). Operations denominated in foreign currency are reflected in reports in national currency by recalculating foreign currency amount using Bank of Namibia exchange rate. Foreign currency transactions are valued at the prevailing exchange rate on the day of the transaction at the valued at market.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The base of recording Budget execution transactions are recorded on cash basis, the fiscal year is the same as the financial year (April to March).  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  All transactions in assets and liabilities are recorded as net basis, acquisition less disposals.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Ministry of Finance is the primary disseminator of detailed fiscal data for Nepal, although the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) also compiles and disseminates analytical fiscal data, mainly for its own analytical purposes. MOF data are compiled by the Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO), one of six departments in the MOF. Both MOF and NRB data cover budgetary central government accounts. Data for extra budgetary units and local governments are not included. The methodologies used in compiling and presenting data are based on national practice and are not in accordance with ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986"" (""GFSM""). See plans for improvement. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The institutional coverage of both sets of data is the same and comprises units covered by the government's budgetary accounts. The operations of extra budgetary agencies are not included. Partial data for local governments, covering district development committees, but not municipalities, are currently compiled by the Ministry of Local Development (MLD). See plans for improvement. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Since 2011/12 the budgetary classification has been changed as following:Revenue and Grants Tax Revenue Non-Tax Revenue GrantsFinancing (Principal Refund ) Previous years cash balance and arrears Total Expenditure Recurrent Capital FinancingSurplus (+) Deficit (-) Before Foreign Grant Financing Net internal loan Net investment External-Net Borrowing Domestic –Net BorrowingCash Balance Surplush (+) Deficit (-) 2.4.1 Valuation  In both sets of data, transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in Nepali rupees at the foreign currency rate prevailing on the day the transactions were made.  2.4.2 Recording basis  With the exception of foreign grants and loans, MOF data are recorded on a cash basis. Revenue is recorded when checks or cash are received and expenditure is recorded when checks are issued and cash disbursed. Foreign grants and loans are treated on an accrual basis.All NRB data are recorded on a cash basis. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  All transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Expand data coverage to include activities of units outside the budget, including revolving funds, special funds, welfare funds, and earmarked revenues. Government of Nepal is now working out on accrual accounting framework so that all Trust Funds are also reported. It is expected to be completed within four years Compile data on general government operations based on local government data compiled and reported by the Ministry of Local Development (MLD). This process would be initiated in two stages: the first would incorporate existing MLD data on municipalities; the second would incorporate data on district development committees, which the MLD is currently working to compile. But, compilation has not been completed the municipalities data. Compile data in accordance with international standards, as provided in ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986"" (""GFSM""). GFS compliant report has been published and widely circulated. From FY 2011/12 expenditure and revenue coding have been changed to fully comply with GFS standards.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The report on fiscal sector statistical data compiles transactions of the restricted nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), on a monthly basis. The NFPS includes the central government (budgetary central government (GCP), the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute, and the Alcaldía de Managua) and public enterprises (National Electrical Transmission Enterprise and Nicaraguan Water and Sewerage Enterprise). The General Budget Directorate (DGP) of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) prepares fiscal statistics focusing primarily on total revenue and expenditure transactions (including net acquisition of nonfinancial assets) of the GCP, except the payment of external interest and domestic interest on government borrowing from the central bank. The Fiscal Programming Department (DPF) of the Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) compiles data on transactions related to the net acquisition of financial assets and liabilities, that is, net domestic and external financing, with the exception of floating debt, redemptions of indemnification bonds, Treasury bonds, promissory notes, and government bills. The two institutions share the information available in their databases and collaborate closely in the performance of their functions. The monthly data provided by the DGP of the MHCP to the CBN authorities have a lag of not more than 30 days. The MHCP and the CBN also disseminate fiscal data in their respective statistical publications. The DGP also processes data in the GCP balance sheet pertaining to tied grants given to finance investment projects, as well as net domestic credit of the rest of the financial system, which is recorded on a cash basis. The CBN processes and provides the DGP with data on cash grants from international organizations to be used primarily for balance of payments support. It also processes data on net domestic and external credit to the GCP. The monthly presentation of NFPS data has been undergoing changes in recent years to reflect the breakdown and disaggregation of NFPS accounts, as a result of the new requirements for macroeconomic analysis dictated by the country’s economic circumstances. Annual, quarterly, and monthly statistics are expressed in thousands of córdobas and as a percentage of GDP, and are published by the central bank both in hard copy and on the internet in monthly and quarterly bulletins and in the annual report. The NFPS statistical data are prepared in accordance with the IMF classification methodology, showing cash-basis data. The presentation and classifications are prepared on the basis of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001. However, external grants, which should be recorded as revenue, are recorded on a separate line in the NFPS consolidated balance sheet as a performance variable, before and after the overall surplus or deficit. This is attributable to the fact that Nicaragua receives enormous amounts of such resources to finance the fiscal gap. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Unit Coverage 1. Total revenue and expenditure The General Budget Directorate (DGP) records all transactions of the institutions that make up the GCP, which includes ministries and government agencies under the direction of the GCP. The DGP attaches to the General Budget Law of the Republic the budgets of the Social Security Institute (INSS), autonomous agencies, and public utilities, whether or not they receive government support and capital transfers. The CBN Fiscal Programming Department prepares the Nonfinancial Public Sector Consolidation, included in the Economic and Financial Program agreed with the IMF, and monitors public enterprises, the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute, and the Alcaldía de Managua. The data on public enterprises cover the National Electrical Transmission Corporation (ENTRESA) and the Nicaraguan Water and Sewerage Enterprise (ENACAL).  2. Domestic and external financing and funds obtained from the privatization of financial assets For the NFPS consolidation, the monetary survey is the source of data on net domestic credit (deposits and securities) granted to the government by the CBN, as well as redemptions of Negotiable Investment Certificates (CENIs). Data on net credit of the rest of the financial system, placements and redemptions of Indemnification Bonds (BPIs), treasury bonds, promissory notes, bills, and suppliers are provided by the DGP of the MHCP. For the rest of general government (INSS and ALMA) and the public enterprises (ENTRESA and ENACAL), the information is supplied by those institutions directly to the CBN. Transaction Coverage All NFPS transactions in local and foreign currency. Geographic Coverage The entire national territory for the central government. Only ALMA for the municipal governments. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Revenues Taxes Social contributions Other revenue Expenditure Employee remuneration Purchases of goods and services Interest Current and capital transfers Social benefits Other expenditure Net operating balance Net acquisition of nonfinancial assets Cash surplus or deficit before grants (3-4) External grants Cash surplus or deficit after grants (5-6) Net domestic financing  Of which: BCN  Net external revenue from privatization  Memorandum item:  Current savings 2.4.1 Valuation  The statistical data are compiled and published in córdobas. Transactions denominated in dollars or other currencies are converted to córdobas at the exchange rate in effect at the time of the transactions. 2.4.2 Recording basis  1. Total revenue and expenditure Time of recording: The accounting procedure for recording total revenue and expenditure NFPS transactions is as follows: NFPS revenue is recorded on a cash basis and expenditures are a combination of cash-basis transactions and transactions not involving a cash flow, such as accrued transactions, primarily those associated with payments in connection with investment projects. After the data are aggregated and consolidated, they are adjusted to yield the values shown in the balance sheet of the general government, public enterprises, and the consolidated NFPS; these data are reconciled with the external sector data (debt service and disbursements) and the monetary sector (loans, deposits, and the corresponding fiscal accounts).  2. Financing Time of recording: Transactions are recorded on a cash basis. The components of external financing consisting of disbursements, amortizations, and external assets are recorded on a cash basis. Under domestic financing, items representing central bank credit, the rest of the financial system, and privatization receipts are also recorded on a cash basis.",
124,124,125,NER,Niger,2001,2001,2001,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Data on central government operations are given in the government financial operations table (TOFE). The presentation is determined by WAEMU based on standardization of the TOFEs of member states of the West African Union. The data are compiled in accordance with the statistical framework defined in the 1986 edition of the IMF A Manual on Government Finance Statistics (the Manual). An internal methodological note defines the principal aggregates as follows: Revenue includes all nonrefundable payments made to the government, whether required or unrequited, with the exception of grants from domestic or foreign donors; Expenditure includes the nonrepayable obligations of central government, whether requited or unrequited; Net lending constitutes government operations related to claims on third parties for general policy purposes; Financing represents those financial operations executed for liquidity purposes. The detailed functional classification of expenditure is based on the nomenclature and budgetary classification of the organic statute governing the budget laws of Niger. The data presented in the TOFE are broken down into: Tax revenue, nontax revenue, and grants Current expenditure and capital expenditure Interest on the public debt Domestic financing and external financing The main balances derived from the TOFE are: The overall balance (on a payment order basis excluding grants), defined as the difference between total budget revenue (including the budget annexes and special accounts) excluding grants and total expenditure and net lending; The basic overall balance obtained as the difference between total budget revenue minus grants and total expenditure minus loans, excluding investment expenditure financed with external resources (HIPC resources included); The basic primary balance calculated as the difference between total revenue excluding grants and total expenditure and loans, with the exception of capital expenditure using foreign resources (including HIPC funds); The balance on a cash basis obtained from the overall balance on a payments basis, including changes in arrears. These different balances are calculated taking grants into account as needed. The TOFE financing balance is, by definition, equal to but bears the opposite sign of the balanceon a cash basis. It represents the net changes in government liabilities. It is broken down into domestic and external financing. TOFE annual data are available for 1983 onwards and monthly data only for 1996 onwards. In addition, annual data are available in the BCEAO’s Information and Statistics Bulletin—Monetary Statistics (published quarterly in French). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage: All administrative units resident in the economic territory of Niger and the national offices and divisions of embassies and missions abroad are included in the coverage of the data. Transaction Coverage: The data cover all the transactions of central government. Unit Coverage: Directive No. 06-98/CM/UEMOA, amended by Directive No. 06-99/CM/UEMOA defines the scope of the WAEMU TOFE, which covers: Central government, comprising the ministries and national institutions; Local governments and local government establishments whose operations are not included in central government; Autonomous agencies, such as administrative public institutions, autonomous social security, provident and pension funds, sinking funds, price equalization and stabilization funds, and funds financed with government resources. The Directorate of Financial Studies and Reforms (DEFR) of the Ministry of Finance and Economy is responsible for compiling the data on central government fiscal aggregates. These aggregates, compiled in thousands of CFA francs, do not cover the national social security fund, local governments, and administrative public sector. Data for compiling the government financial operations table (TOFE) come from a variety of sources: General Treasury, Directorate General of Budget, Directorate General of Taxes, Directorate General of Customs, and the Central Bank. They cover execution of the general budget, investment budget, special Treasury accounts including the National Pension Fund, budget annexes, and external budgetary assistance mobilized, as well as trends in the government’s net position. Income and expenditure are recorded gross with out offsetting certain revenue and expenditure items, unless they pertain to the current operations of market production units, in which cases only the balances are taken into account.  Moreover, central government budgetary aggregates are compiled by the Ministry of Finance based on a classification by heading, section, and chapter of government revenue and expenditure following the structure of the budget.  Exceptions to coverage  In practice, the Nigerien TOFE does not currently take into account the following units: Government, strictly speaking, as covered in the general budget, including the investment budget; Subdivisions of government with a special account at the Treasury, such as: the government parking lot, the state olympic swimming pool, the national retirement fund, bonded warehouses, tourism development fund, national museum, security fund, autonomous fund for financing road maintenance, and the autonomous center for amortization of the domestic public debt.  Since September 2002, efforts have been made to expand the institutional scope of the TOFE to cover administrative public institutions (EPA), but these institutions have still not been consolidated with government.  Since 2002 there are no longer budget annexes. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Since FY 2003, a new budget classification has been in effect, in keeping with the WAEMU directive on harmonizing budget classifications in member states of the Union. Revenue is grouped under a single heading and broken down by type into articles, paragraphs, and lines. Expenditure is divided into six headings. Under each heading, expenditure is broken down by service into sections and chapters, and by type into articles, paragraphs and lines. The special Treasury accounts are grouped into revenue and expenditure, under one heading. The new budget classification also includes a functional classification of expenditure, namely the classification of functions of government (COFOG), following the 2001 edition of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Data on central government operations are recorded on a cash basis (payment orders) for revenue and on an accruals basis for expenditure, except for investment expenditure using domestic resources, which is recorded on a commitments basis.",
125,125,126,NGA,Nigeria,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Data on the operations of federal Government of Nigeria are compiled and disseminated by the Statistics and Publication Division of Economic Research & Policy Management department (ER & PMD) of The Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF), in the “Quarterly Performance Report of the Economy” prepared for the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) also disseminates data in the Bank’s Monthly & Annual reports published by the Research Department. Data for states and Local government are currently excluded from these: Interest payments Goods and Services & Transfer External Debt Debts owed to Local Contractor Pensions Development Expenditure & Net Lending: Projects Net Lending Overall Surplus/Deficit:- Financing: Foreign Domestic Bank Non-Bank Privatization Fund Others. The FMF analytical presentation of Federal Government operations and the definitions of the principal aggregates are in general in accordance with the statistical framework set out in the IMF “Manual on Government Finance Statistics” (1986) (GFS Manual). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage: All capital and current transactions are captured except for some grants in kind. In addition, due to lags in reporting, recent month data are incomplete. Unit Coverage: The Federal Government data covers the operations of all Federal Government line Ministries and the various Federal Government Institutions/Agencies, Ministries Extra-Ministerial Departments. Statutory revenue and value added tax allocations are made from Vat Pool Account. Social Security benefits are provided in a very little number of establishments. The periodicity of the raw data generated from Ministries/Departments/Agencies is collated by OAGF at intervals of one month following the period to be reported on. One month lag. General Government operations (encourage extension): Besides the Federal Government Units there are 36 States and Federal Capital Territory and 774 Local Government Councils in Nigeria. Currently data for these units are not fully available hence they are not consolidated into general government statement. There is no well-defined regulation to force these units to report their fiscal operations to the central government. Any data obtained from them are obtained by moral persuasion. The analytical framework for central government is presented as follows: Revenue Description: Oil Revenue Non- Oil Revenue  Expenditure Description: Recurrent Expenditure: Development Expenditure & Net lending Projects Net Lending  Overall Surplus/Deficit  Financing: Foreign Domestic: Bank Non-Bank Privatisation Fund Others. The Financial year for the Federal Government recurrent and Capital budget is January - December.  Exceptions to coverage  Transactions are recorded on a cash basis and all transactions are covered with the exception of some grants in kind. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  FMF Federal Government Operations analytical table includes a summarized classification of all major aggregates. In the analytical table, Oil Revenue is classified by Direct Crude sales or Export, Liquid Gas Export, PPT, Royalties, Rent etc. while Non-Oil Revenue is Classified by customs & Excise Duties, Import Duties, Company Income Tax (CIT), Value Added Tax (VAT), Federal Government Independent Revenue, Education Tax and Tax on Petroleum Products. Expenditure by major economic classification is disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital. Expenditure based on the budget. Recurrent expenditures distinguish Wages and salaries, Interest Payments, Debt Service Payments, Debts owed to Local Contractors, Payments for goods and services and transfers. There is no functional classification of at present. See plans for improvement 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions in foreign currency are converted at the prevailing official exchange rate at the time of transaction.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Time of recording: Data for Federal Government operations are recorded on a cash basis. Revenue is recorded when FIRS and Customs Services make collections. Expenditure is recorded when checks are written or payments made. In the case of Grants and loans to development projects, the capital expenditure is recorded when goods and services are received. Closing of accounts: The closing of the accounts at the end of the financial year implies that no more checks are written for the year. The annual accounts are prepared by the OAGF 6 months after the end of the financial year and the audited accounts are available 6 months after. This brings the availability of audited data to 12 months after the end of the financial year. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustment for grossing & netting: All transactions are recorded on a gross basis, except for tax refunds, which are netted against revenue. Adjustments are made to rectify miscalculation of data and data source are cross-checked for accuracy. Implement the statistical framework set out in the IMF's Manual on Government Finance Statistics (2001) (GFS Manual). A functional classification of federal government expenditure will be developed.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Government (central and general) transactions data are organized for analytical purposes broadly using the system of definitions and classifications in the IMF’s Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986 (GFSM86) for the major fiscal aggregates—revenue, expenditure, deficit/surplus, and breakdowns of financing. However, some non-financial public enterprises outside the framework of central government also carry out some quasi-fiscal activities. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The statistics of government operations cover the budgetary federal (central) government, and the public sector development program. Data are disseminated in millions of Pakistan rupees on general government operations, which cover the budgetary central government and the provincial governments. The data excludes the extra-budgetary fund (the Zakat Fund), social security funds, and locally financed operation of district governments. Data are disseminated on: revenue; expenditure; the balance (deficit/surplus); and financing, with financing broken down into domestic bank financing, domestic non-bank financing, and financing from the rest of the world. As part of expenditure, total interest payments are disseminated (and, for central government, with breakdowns of domestic and foreign interest payments). The data are based on the actual accounting records of the budgetary units and are recorded on a cash basis.  Exceptions to coverage  The data exclude the extra budgetary fund (the Zakat Fund), social security funds, and locally financed operations of district governments, and local governments. Expenditure funded from the federal budget for district and local government operations are accounted for in the federal government budget as grants and subsidies. Also excluded are other funds/enterprises operated with donor support that carry out some quasi-fiscal activities. The main such fund is the Poverty Alleviation Fund, which is sponsored by donors including the World Bank and provides credits for enterprise development and grants for community physical infrastructure activities, as well as training to communities. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classification system used to classify the components of the major fiscal aggregates is broadly in accordance with GFSM86. Revenue consists of tax and non-tax revenues classified according to the GFSM86. Expenditure is by economic classification of limited breakdowns to current, and development and net lending. The interest expenditure is shown separately (with breakdowns by foreign and domestic for central government interest payments). There is some mixture of economic and functional classification where defense expenditure is a separate item of current expenditure. In addition the detailed functional classification of government expenditure is on the basis of the System of National Accounts. The Ministry of Finance classifies functional expenditures using “Chart of Classification of Federal and Provincial Governments: receipts and disbursement”, Appendix 2 to the Accounting Code Volume 1 published by the Auditor General. 2.4.1 Valuation  The exchange rates to convert foreign currency denominated transactions are on the basis of the interbank exchange rate as used by the State Bank of Pakistan at the time of transactions.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The transactions are recorded on a cash basis, and exclude expenditure arrears. There is no complementary period. The implementation of accrual accounting will occur over an extended period and the cash basis of reporting on government activities will be used for some time to come. The fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Data are on gross basis for central government operations and provincial governments’ operations, with a few exceptions. Disseminated revenue data comprise tax revenue of the federal government on a net basis with an adjustment of tax revenue transfers to the provincial tax pool. In addition, consolidated central government lending operations are recorded net of repayments.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The data on central government and public sector transactions are organized in accordance with the general guidelines of the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" (""GFSM""). However, the national revenue and expenditure classifications are different from those in the IMF manual. Very generally speaking, revenue is defined as the sum of all unrequited inflows and nonrecoverable requited inflows, plus noncompulsory, nonrecoverable, unrequited inflows received from other governments and international institutions (grants). Expenditure consists of nonrecoverable, requited, and unrequited current or capital payments. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage: Includes the operations of entities belonging to the public sector, present throughout the country, which is made up of 9 provinces and 3 indigenous communities. Unit Coverage: In the quarterly and annual statistics of the Directorate of Statistics and Census, the public sector covers: the central government (budgetary entities) decentralized institutions (nonbusiness) nonfinancial public enterprises public financial intermediaries local governments  In the quarterly and annual reports of the Budget Directorate, the General State Budget covers all public sector institutions except local governments. The annual report of the Controller General of the Republic does not include local governments in the public sector aggregates. However, the report does provide figures on the budget execution of local governments. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The same revenue and expenditure classification system is used in the quarterly and annual publications of the Directorate of Statistics and Census, in the quarterly and annual reports of the Directorate of the Budget on Execution of the General State Budget, and in the Annual Report of the Controller General of the Republic. Revenue: Classified according to the National Manual on Budgetary Classifications of Revenue. Revenue consists of: Current revenue, which in turn is divided into (a) tax revenue, subdivided into direct and indirect; (b) nontax revenue; (c) other current revenue; cash on hand and in banks; Capital revenue, which in turn is divided into (a) own resources; (b) credit resources, subdivided into domestic and foreign; (c) other capital revenue; and (d) cash on hand and in banks.  Expenditure: Classified according to the National Manual on Budgetary Classifications of Expenditure, which mainly includes expenditure classifications by purpose and by type (current, including public debt service, and investment). Data are prepared annually based on the economic and functional classifications. Expenditure is recorded on a commitment basis. The financing concept is not used in the statistics prepared by the Directorate of Statistics and Census nor in the reports of the Budget Directorate. The annual report of the Controller General of the Republic shows budget financing of the central government. 2.4.1 Valuation  No valuation adjustments are made.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Revenue is recorded on a cash basis, and expenditure, on a commitment basis.",
131,131,132,PNG,Papua New Guinea,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MFT) provides source data on central government operations to the National Statistical Office (NSO) for compilation of Papua New Guinea’s GFS. The GFS are compiled from the annual financial statements of the national government authorities, according to the standards laid down in the 1986 draft of “A Manual of Government Finance Statistics” published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). (They are also published in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The Yearbook includes comparable figures for more than a hundred IMF member countries.) In addition to measure of the major components of government operations, GFS include detailed breakdowns of tax and non-tax revenues and functional and economic classifications of expenditure. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Government is defined as budgetary central government covering all units performing government functions, that is, the implementation of public policy through the provision of primarily non-commercial services and the transfer of income, supported mainly by compulsory levies on other institutional sectors.  Exceptions to coverage  Exceptions to the coverage of government are as follows:(1) Government owned and / or controlled units, which sell industrial or commercial goods and services to the public on large scale, are excluded from government and are classified separately as non-financial public enterprises.(2) Governments owned and /or controlled financial institutions are also classified separately as public financial institutions.(3) Government finance statistics exclude transfer payments, which are excluded from the economic accounts aggregate “government final consumption expenditure”.(4) Government finance statistics do not include information on local government operations. There are about 230 community and local level governments operating in PNG. However, the National Statistical Office (NSO) has been unable to obtain sufficient information on their income and expenditure to produce meaning estimates for recent years. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Transactions are generally classified by their characteristics at the time of payment rather than by any subsequent use of funds. Classifications is based on; (a) whether transactions are government payments or receipts; (b) whether they are repayable; (c) whether they are required or non-requited; (d) if non-repayable, whether they are capital or current; (e) if repayable, whether they involve a government financial asset or liability; (f) if repayable, whether they are undertaken for liquidity management purposes or for reasons of government policy.Revenue includes all non-repayable government receipts, whether requited or unrequited and whether for current or capital purposes. A separate category is used for government lending and comprises government transactions in claims upon others undertaken for purposes of public policy rather than for management of government liquidity.Net lending covers both loans and equities. The deficient or surplus is determined by calculating the total revenue and grants minus the total of expenditure and net lending. If this difference is positive; it is labeled as a surplus; if it is negative; it is labeled as a deficit. By definition financing is equal in magnitude to deficit or surplus, but has the opposite sign. Financing covers transactions involving government liabilities, any financial assets held by the government for the purposes of liquidity rather than public policy, and the changes in the government holdings of currency and deposits.Within the major components of payments and receipts, transactions are further classified by a number of other criteria. Revenue is divided between tax and non-tax revenue. Tax revenue is classified according to base upon which the tax is levied, that is income, sales, import, property, payrolls etc. Expenditure is classified by the function or purpose for which it is made, and by its economic characteristics. Government net lending and capital expenditure are also classified according to the purposes for which they are provided. Financing is divided between domestic financing, obtained from residents, and foreign financing obtained from non-residents. Financing is further classified by type of debt holder and by type of debt instrument involved. The Classification of government debt is similar to the classification of financing. 2.4.1 Valuation  GFS are compiled on a cash basis.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Data for the principal aggregates are on a cash basis. Receipts and expenditure shown are amounts actually received and spent in the financial year. Goods or services received are brought into account in the year of payment, regardless of when they were received. Similarly income receivable in one year but received in a subsequent year is brought into account in a year of receipt. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  To provide as a complete presentation of government operations as possible, data are generally shown on a gross basis, so that the cost of collecting taxes, for example, is included in expenditure rather than being offset against taxation revenue.",
132,132,133,PRY,Paraguay,2001,2001,2001,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Fiscal Policy Directorate (DPF) of the Ministry of Finance Subsecretariat of State for Economy and Integration compiles the government finance statistics (GFS) of the central administration on a monthly basis and those of the central government and nonfinancial public sector on a quarterly basis, for analysis and decision-making by the fiscal authority. A report about Central Administration is disseminated to the press on a monthly basis, one month after the reference period.GFS for the central government, public enterprises, and the nonfinancial public sector is disseminated to the public in the Ministry of Finance's web site three months after the reference period. The DPF has occasionally disseminated a ""Boletín Fiscal"" containing quarterly information on the central administration and the nonfinancial public sector with partial coverage. No information is compiled for local governments, as they are not covered by the Overall National Budget (which includes the central administration, decentralized agencies of the central government, social security, and nonfinancial and financial public enterprises).  The DPF's primary sources for government finance statistics are: a) the budget execution information from the Integrated Financial Administration System (SIAF), which is an online system currently covering Central Administration institutions and some decentralized institutions. b) those public institutions which are not yet connected to the SIAF, send their budget execution print-outs monthly to Ministry of Finance. The GFS based on the previous mentioned sources can be compared to in the ""Informe Financiero"" [Financial Report] of the Ministry of Finance's Directorate General of Government Accounting, which contains data on government accrual-basis accounting, budget execution, and debt. The ""Informe Financiero"", which is provided for in the laws of the Republic, uses the budget classification established in the Budget Law, but does not include analytical tables showing ""above-the-line"" and ""below-the-line"" fiscal performance, except for the central administration (a summary table of savings, investment, surplus/deficit, and financing is included).  To compile government finance statistics for the central administration, the central government, and the nonfinancial public sector, the DPF follows international standards, using the IMF's 1986 ""Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" as a general reference, but with a few differences. The main difference for the Central Administration analytical tables, is in the use of the criterion pertaining to the ""revenue collected"" and ""expenditure committed"" basis (debt service is recorded based on the payment authorization schedule, which is very close to the payment due date). Another difference is the inclusion of loans granted and shares purchased for economic policy purposes in capital expenditure and the inclusion of recoveries of said loans in capital revenue (currently, modifications have been made, such as the category “Total Expenditure and Lending minus Repayments”, remaining the purchase of shares among capital expenditures) . The recording of external debt flows in the case of loans on lent domestically is highly specific: external disbursements are recorded in the accounts of the implementing institution and external service of the debt in the accounts of the paying institution, regardless of what institution incurred the external debt. The deficit is shown on a mixed basis with revenues using cash basis an expenditures using ""committed"" basis, and the change in floating debt is not shown separately so as to be able to make the deficit/surplus adjustment on a cash basis. (Since 2003, Central Administration analytical tables show a higher level of disaggregation including changes in the floating debt).  The financing identified consists of domestic and external long-term public debt, with amortization recorded according to maturity.In the DPF's government finance statistics, revenue consists of inflows that do not generate repayment obligations; however, as mentioned above, it also includes loan recoveries . Expenditure is nonreimbursable but also includes loans granted (loan recoveries and loans granted have been included in the new category “Total Expenditures and Lending minus Repayments”) and shares acquired. Financing shows disbursements of and repayments falling due on domestic and external long-term debt, and a residual category ""use of or increase in deposits."" (It is necessary to mention that currently, the category “use of or increase in deposits”, reflects the actual variation of deposits in the Central Bank and in the Financial System and no longer is a residual category). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage: The coverage of departmental government operations is incomplete owing to the lag with which many of these governments submit the information. Transaction Coverage: The coverage of expenditure financed externally via the direct payment method is incomplete because the implementing institutions do not submit the information. The coverage of floating debt and various other forms of financing long-term debt is also incomplete for nonfinancial public sector but Central Administration. Unit Coverage: 1. Accounts of the consolidated central government The coverage includes the central administration, decentralized agencies (including those designated ""departmental governments""), and social security. The DPF calls this grouping Central Government. The Central Administration consists of the legislative branch, the executive branch, the judiciary, the Public Treasury and its offices. The information on the central administration includes the operations of the Postal Directorate, which, for statistical purposes, should be classified as a nonfinancial public enterprise.  The decentralized agencies include 33 public agencies organized as public law institutions with legal status and their own assets, which report to the President of the Republic. They comprise ten development promotion agencies, four educational institutions, two regulatory agencies, and 17 departmental governments that implement central government policy at the departmental level.  Social Security is made up of the Social Welfare Institute, even though the DPF includes four retirement and pension funds. These four funds are actually financial institutions, which, for statistical purposes, the DPF is considering reclassifying outside the sector. (At present, these four funds are classified in the Financial Public Sector) It should be noted that the coverage of the data is not always complete; as many governments and some decentralized agencies are substantially late in submitting budget execution information to the Ministry of Finance. The primary information may not be complete when the final annual figures are prepared in February of the following year. The information audited by the Audit Office no later than eight months after the end of the year are not used to adjust the annual figures.  2. Coverage of nonfinancial public sector operations (encouraged extension)  The coverage includes operations of the central government and of the eight nonfinancial public enterprises. The fiscal statistics do not include data from the country's various municipalities. The Fiscal Policy Directorate currently has a medium-term plan to include the largest municipalities. Also not included are the binational enterprises Itaipú and Yacyretá, which do not report to the Ministry of Finance. The Fiscal Policy Directorate (DPF) of the Ministry of Finance Subsecretariat of State for Economy and Integration compiles the government finance statistics (GFS) of the central administration on a monthly basis for analysis and decision-making by the fiscal authority. The report “Informe de Coyuntura Fiscal de la Administración Central Correspondiente al mes de …” (Central Administration´s report on Financial Situation) is disseminated to the press on a monthly basis, one month after the reference period. The DPF has occasionally disseminated a ""Boletín Fiscal"" containing quarterly information on the central administration.  The DPF's primary sources for government finance statistics are: a) the budget execution information from the Integrated Financial Administration System (SIAF), which is an online system currently covering Central Administration institutions and some decentralized institutions. b) those public institutions which are not yet connected to the SIAF, send their budget execution print-outs monthly to Ministry of Finance. The GFS based on the previous mentioned sources are later compared with in the ""Informe Financiero"" [Financial Report] of the Subsecretariat of Finance of the Ministry of Finance. The “Informe Financiero”, which is provided for in the laws of the Republic, uses the budget classifiers established in the Budget Law, but does not include analytical tables showing ""above-the-line"" and ""below-the-line"" fiscal performance, except for the central administration (a summary table of savings, investment, surplus/deficit, and financing is included).  To compile government finance statistics for the central administration, the central government, and the nonfinancial public sector, the DPF follows international standards, using the IMF's 1986 ""Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" as a general reference, but with a few differences. The main difference for the Central Administration analytical tables, is in the use of the criterion pertaining to the ""revenue collected"" and ""expenditure committed"" basis (debt service is recorded based on the payment authorization schedule, which is very close to the payment due date). Another difference is the inclusion of loans granted and shares purchased for economic policy purposes in capital expenditure and the inclusion of recoveries of said loans in capital revenue (currently, modifications have been included, such as the category “Total Expenditure and Lending minus Repayments”, remaining the purchase of shares among capital expenditures) . The recording of external debt flows in the case of loans on lent domestically is highly specific: external disbursements are recorded in the accounts of the implementing institution and external service of the debt in the accounts of the paying institution, regardless of what institution incurred the external debt. The deficit is shown on a mixed basis with revenues using cash basis an expenditure ""committed"" basis, and the change in floating debt is not shown separately so as to be able to make the deficit/surplus adjustment on a cash basis. (Since 2003, Central Administration analytical tables show a higher level of disaggregation including changes in the floating debt). The financing identified consists of domestic and external long-term public debt, with amortization recorded according to maturity, and includes a residual category ""use of or increase in deposits."" Interest is shown separately for domestic debt and external debt and is recorded on the basis of the payment due date. The fiscal year is January-December.  Unrecorded activity  At present, all budgeted activities are recorded. If a non-budgeted activity is to be carried out, it must first be included in the budget, subject to legislative approval, and then executed. Consequently, there are no off-budget activities. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The format of the analytical table, which is applied to the various sub-sectors, includes a breakdown of revenue, expenditure, and financing in the same table. Tax revenues are defined as compulsory, unrequited, nonrepayable contributions exacted by the government and classified according to the tax base. Tax revenues are not reduced by any governmental expenditure for the collection and administration of taxes, but do include penalties and interest collected on arrears. Nontax revenues include any current revenue of government not involving compulsory payments (taxes) and are classified by source. Nontax revenues include social security contributions. The economic classification is used for expenditure, which is broken down into current and capital expenditure. Current expenditure is further broken down into personal services, goods and services, interest, and transfers. Financial charges are identified separately but grouped with interest and not in the goods and services category (with the new analytical table applied since 2003, financial charges are grouped in the goods and services category) . Current expenditure does not include the purchase of goods and services that are used for the gross capital formation of government and are part of capital expenditure. Capital expenditure consists of physical investment, and capital transfers. Disbursements and the amortization of domestic and external long-term debt are identified. No classification by class of debt holder or type of instrument is disseminated. (A classification of the external debt by holder is provided by the new analytical table).  Additional information The ""Informe Financiero"" of the Directorate General of Government Accounting of the Ministry of Finance Subsecretariat of State for Financial Administration contains data on government accrual-basis accounting, budget execution, and debt. The “Informe Financiero” has two versions, the first one is annual and comprises the whole public sector but local governments and follows the rules established r in the laws of the Republic. This annual information includes a full breakdown of the balance sheet accounts, profit and loss statement, and the budgetary position in respect of collected revenue and ""committed"" expenditure. A summary of budget execution on a cash basis is also shown for the central administration. The second version has a monthly periodicity and comprises Central Administration´s budget execution and accrual-basis accounting. GFS of the central government and nonfinancial public sector are quarterly compiled by the DPF and disseminated on the Internet three months after the reference period. Regularly, the Directorate General of Government Accounting compiles monthly information for the central administration and the National Treasury including budget execution and accrual-basis accounting, this information is available at the Directorate of Accounting web site.The Ministry of Finance Fiscal Policy Directorate is adjusting its data base in order to calculate ""below-the-line"" fiscal performance , based on the MERCOSUR harmonized methodology and reflecting the change in net fiscal debt. 2.4.1 Valuation  Transactions in foreign currency are converted into guaraníes at the average buying and selling exchange rate on the day of the operation.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Time of recording: Budget execution by the central administration, consolidated central government, and nonfinancial public sector is recorded on a mixed basis: revenue collected and expenditure ""committed” . Only the data for the central administration can be obtained on a cash basis as well. Debt service is recorded on the date in the payment authorization schedule, which is very close to the payment due date. At present, there are significant lags between the expenditure commitment and the payment, especially in the procurement of goods and services. This is due to the fact that payment execution is based on the Cash Flow Plan, which is more restrictive than the budget. The Law on Financial Administration establishes the following stages of budget execution: (a) Income:  - Validation: Identification of the source and financial/economic quantification of the amount of the resource to be collected. - Collection: Actual receipt of the resource originating in an accrued and validated inflow. (b) Expenditure:  - Projection: As the specific use of the budget appropriation. - Commitment: Payment commitment originating in a legal financial obligation between a government agency or institution and an individual or legal entity. - Payment: Partial or full fulfillment of the obligations in question.  It should be noted that there is no certainty that all decentralized institutions of the central government and nonfinancial public enterprises are reporting on a ""committed"" expenditure basis, as no regular comparison is made between budget execution and their accrual-basis accounts. Closing of accounts: The fiscal year is the calendar year, and once the year has ended operations can no longer be ""committed."" However, previously committed expenditure can be paid up to end-February. Committed expenditure not paid by end-February can be reprogrammed in the new fiscal year budget. The DPF does not as yet reconcile fiscal account debt service and disbursement data with the external sector statistics compiled by the BCP. Nor are domestic financing data regularly reconciled with the BCP's figures.",

Domestic borrowing is further divided between those provided by the banking and non-banking sectors. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of foreign currency transactions: Flow amounts in foreign currency are converted to the exchange rate prevailing at the time that the transaction takes place while stock amounts are valued based on the prevailing market exchange rate for the reporting date.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The BTr Accounting Service (AS) already adopts modified accrual basis of recording NG transaction upon recommendation of COA. This includes other revenue collections such as interest income but not for BIR and BOC collections, as well as Interest payments and other financial expenses. However, the data for the NG COR are still recorded on a cash basis but heading towards accrual.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  BIR and BOC collections reported in the NG COR are net of actual tax refunds paid for the month. This is line with the GFS guidelines on recording tax refunds. NG Financing are reported in the NG Cash Operations Report in gross while bond exchanges are part of the amortization.

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  With respect to budget execution, the guidelines appear in the Financial Administration Law (Law No. 1/86 of December 30) and classification follows the law defining classifiers of revenue and expenditure. Execution is in accordance with the standards and procedures for budget execution. To a large extent, these standards follow the recommendations of international institutions. Responsibility for compiling the statistical data on the fiscal sector lies with the Budget Directorate, which shares this responsibility with the Planning Directorate. The Budget Directorate compiles the data related to current revenue and expenditure. Capital expenditure and public investment are compiled by the Planning Directorate. The data on budget execution are disseminated according to the Government Financial Operations Table (TOFE) in which all government operations during the fiscal year are recorded. Total revenue includes current revenue and grants. Total expenditure consists of current and capital expenditure. The analytical framework used by the country is generally consistent with that recommended in the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM), 1986. However, there are some differences in key definitions at the highest level of aggregation: Total revenue – includes revenue defined as proceeds that do not generate a repayment obligation, plus grants defined as transfers received without consideration, plus financing received (disbursements) defined as increases in commitments and involving future payment. Total expenditure – includes expenditure defined as non-refundable payments as defined in the GFSM, plus repayments (reduction of commitments). Balances are defined as follows: Current balance excluding interest on the debt: current revenue minus (-) current expenditure excluding interest. Primary balance before grants: current balance minus (-) expenditure financed by the Treasury. Overall balance before grants: current balance minus (-) capital expenditure. Overall balance after grants: overall balance (before grants) plus (+) grants. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage: All operations mentioned above in the analytical framework are covered. Geographic Coverage: The data have national coverage. The statistics compiled cover the following units: Central government (State), Autonomous Region of Principe and Local Governments. The breakdown of revenue and expenditure of autonomous funds and agencies and Social Security is presented in appendices. Regarding budget execution, the guidelines are the Financial Administration Law (Law No. 1/86 of December 30) and classification is in accordance with the law defining the classifiers for revenue and expenditure. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Revenue is classified using an economic classification code and expenditure is classified by organic classification, functional classification, and economic classification. The Government Financial Operations Table has the following structure: Total Revenue (Revenue and Grants) Current Revenue Tax Revenue Direct Taxes Indirect Taxes Import Tax Export Tax Tax on Consumption Imported Products Domestic Products Nontax Revenue Company transfers Fishing licenses Other Grants Total Expenditure Current Expenditure Personnel Expenditure Goods and Services Transfers Other Current Expenditure Unemployment Fund Interest on Debt Capital Expenditure Public Investment Program (PIP) Financed by Treasury Not Financed by Treasury Current Balance excluding Interest on Debt Primary Balance before Grants Overall Balance before Grants Overall Balance (after Grants) Overall Balance (cash basis) Financing Domestic Central Bank (net) Commercial banks (net) External External debt Disbursements Repayment Debt relief 2.4.1 Valuation  All operations are valued at current prices. Operations expressed in foreign currency are converted to domestic currency at the rate of exchange in effect on the day of the operation carried out by the Central Bank. Grants in kind are valued at market prices and posted/recorded at the time the sales equivalent is credited to the Treasury.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Central government operations are generally recorded on the following basis: revenue is recorded in the period when received (checks and cash received); however, expenditure is recorded on the basis of commitments or administrative approval, whenever information is available.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Revenue is collected by the Tax Directorate and adjusted in collaboration with the Budget Directorate and the Treasury Directorate, crossed-checked against information from the Customs Directorate. Data on both revenue and expenditure are adjusted, depending on the availability of information, following the principle of posting gross values; for values posted net, it is assumed that the gross value of the originating transactions is known.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Data on the operations of the central government of Sierra Leone are compiled by the Accountant-General’s Department (AGD) in consultation with the Budget Bureau (BB) of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The Economic Policy and Research Unit (EPRU) of the MoF disseminates the data in its “Quarterly Economic Trends” and semi-annual and annual “Economic Bulletins”. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) also disseminates these data compiled by the MoF in the former’s Half-yearly “BSL Bulletin”, “Annual Report and Statement of Accounts”, “BSL Monthly Economic Review”, and in the BSL’s website.  Comprehensive data for the central government operations that cover all units of government are currently compiled. The budgetary operations of the local government are not compiled. With the current drive towards decentralization and the growing role of the local government as a spending institution or ministry, there is an urgent need to compile and monitor data for the whole of general government (see section II below for encouraged extension).  The AGD compiles monthly, quarterly and annual budgetary data from reports of the Customs and Excise Department, the Income Tax Department and other revenue generating departments as well as returns from BSL on revenue received and expenditures made. The data are reconciled with these departments and the BSL at the weekly Net Domestic financing (NDF) Committee meetings, chaired by the BSL. The data cover the operations of the recurrent budget and the government’s contribution to the development budget. The AGD makes available the data to the Budget Bureau (BB). The BB’s analytical presentation of central government operations is in general accordance with the statistical framework set out in the IMF’s “Manual on Government Finance Statistics” (1986) (GFS Manual). The government does not generally directly lend to public financial enterprises, but it does onlend foreign borrowings. These are presented as government guaranteed debt. Government, as a last resort, acquires equity of private enterprises. It also sells equity of public enterprises and subscribes quotas to international organisations. The subscription is taken from the budget of the Ministry/Department/Agency (MDA) expected to make such payments. Thus, revenue comprises non-repayable government receipts other than grants, and any loan repayments. Grants comprise unrequited, non-repayable, and noncompulsory receipts in cash and in kind. Expenditures comprise government non-repayable payments, quota subscriptions to international organisations, and government lending to government departments/agencies. Capital expenditures, in the Fiscal Profile, include outlays finance by both foreign loans and grants and the government’s contribution to the development budget. The Central Planning Unit (CPU) of the Ministry of Development and Economic Planning (MoDEP) captures the foreign component of the development expenditure. The CPU produces a quarterly Development Expenditure Report, which has both the foreign and domestic components of the development expenditure and classifies expenditure according to project.  Payments of expenditures in arrears are recorded below the line as an item called ‘change in arrears’ and not expenditure. The transfers to the budget of the net proceeds from privatisation are separately recorded below the line as privatisation receipts. Technically speaking privatisation receipts is part of domestic financing, but is reported separately. Thus domestic financing, as presented, excludes privatisation receipts. Total bank and non-bank financing is calculated as net claims of the banking system on all central government units and non-bank financing is calculated as a residual. There is an adjustment to the overall deficit that takes into account the revenue and expenditure float/arrears and errors and omissions. This is represented in the Fiscal Profile as “Unaccounted”. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage: The “Fiscal or Budget Profile” contains all government revenues, all recurrent expenditures and domestic development expenditure. Externally financed development expenditure is reflected in the fiscal profile. The Central Planning Unit (CPU) of MoDEP captures externally financed development expenditure and receives the domestic component from the BB. All grants in kind to the government are valued at market price and captured in the budget. Unit Coverage: The government data cover the operations of the central government units covered by the recurrent and development budgets. These units comprise all government line ministries, departments, and agencies including commissions. With the recent introduction of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), regional breakdown of the budget is emphasized. However, the budgets of the regions are classified under the government MDAs. Extra budgetary funds do not exist.  General government operations (encouraged extension):  One (1) municipality and twelve (12) district councils constitute the local government in Sierra Leone. Currently data for these units are not consolidated into the general government statement. However, the central government operations statement includes transfers to the Ministry of local government (MoLG). The MoLG, in turn, provide financial support to these institutions through its vote.  The MoLG also supervises the Municipality and District Councils. No system exists wherein these entities/establishments report their budgetary operations to the MoF. This makes the production of a consolidated government budgetary operation impossible.  Data on central government aggregates are provided on both cash and commitment bases, especially the former. The data are obtained from records of the Account-General’s Department (AGD) of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Bank of Sierra Leone. Data are denominated in Leones– the domestic currency. The data are broadly structured according to the IMF’s Manual on Government Statistics (1986). A table, called the “Budget Profile” is compiled on a quarterly basis with total revenues and grants offset by total expenditure and net lending to derive an overall fiscal balance. The Budget Profile is disseminated in several government publications. It is first published in the MoF’s “Quarterly Economic Trends”. The table is also contained in the MoF’s “Economic Bulletin” which is published half-yearly and yearly, and the “Budget Statement of Financial and Economic Policies”. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) also publishes budgetary data in their “Monthly Economic Review”, “BSL Bulletin”, and Website.  The AGD compiles monthly Cash-flow statement for the purpose of programme monitoring and has restricted circulation. The Cash-flow Statement is structured along the lines of the IMF’s Manual on Government Finance Statistics but in a summarized form and distributed during the Net Domestic Finance Committee meetings.  Fiscal data encompass only central government operations. The local government sector, being relatively small, is administered as part of the central government and hence depicted as a line item in the budget. Fiscal data are classified as both recurrent and capital and cover expenditures of all government departments, as well as transfers to local government, and payments of public wages and salaries. The outlays by local governments, which also have fewer independent sources of revenues, not funded by central government transfers, are not included in these accounts. In the development budget, capital expenditures that are externally funded are only included after the fiscal and monetary authorities have been notified of these transactions by donor agencies. There are no extrabudgetary funds.  The monthly fiscal data are presented as follows: Total revenue (plus Grants) Domestic revenue Income Tax Department Customs and Excise Department Miscellaneous Programmed funds (grants) Total expenditure Pensions, wages and salaries Goods and services Debt service payment Domestic Foreign Development expenditure  Overall deficit/surplus  Total financing Domestic financing Bank financing  Nonbank financing Foreign financing 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  MoF’s central government operations or “Fiscal Profile” table includes a summarized classification for all the major aggregates. In the table, tax revenue is classified according to the department responsible for collecting the tax. Tax revenue also includes road user charges payable on every gallon of diesel and petrol bought. Non-tax revenue, on the other hand, identifies income from parastatals (public enterprises), royalties on minerals, licenses, freight levy and other revenues collected by the treasury or MDAs but paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF).  Expenditures by the major economic classification are first disaggregated into recurrent and development expenditure based on the budget. All recurrent expenditure is current expenditure. Some current expenditure is included in the development budget. Recurrent expenditure distinguishes wages and salaries, goods and services, interest payments, and transfers. Wages and salaries of the local governments are incorporated in the budget. (In principle, these constitute a transfer from the central government to the local government). Expenditures are also classified by function. Financing is classified according to residence. Foreign financing shows total disbursements or borrowing, amortization and debt relief. Interest and amount due but not paid are reflected the item debt relief. Domestic financing, on the other hand, is classified by creditor and broken down into bank and non-bank financing. As mentioned earlier, domestic financing does not includes privatization receipts.  Supplemental information:  On a monthly basis, the Customs and Excise Department and the Income Tax Department each prepares a Revenue Report showing the actual collections by type of taxes. These data are reconciled with the AGD and the BSL at the weekly Net Domestic Finance (NDF) Committee meetings, chaired by the BSL. On a quarterly basis, the Budget Bureau (BB) of the MoF’s reports on the fiscal developments of the last quarter. In addition to the Fiscal Profile table, the BB disseminates detailed breakdowns of revenue and expenditure. These tables contain monthly and quarterly data on the government’s budgetary operations. The revenue table shows total revenues with a more detailed disaggregation of major taxes (income tax, customs duties, and excise duties, road user charges). The expenditure table covers recurrent expenditure and provides a breakdown by budget vote of wages and salaries and other charges, compiled from AGD’s report on exchequers issues. The table also shows the government’s development expenditure, but excludes capital expenditure made from donor resources. On a quarterly basis, the BB in collaboration with the EPRU prepares a budgetary report for the Cabinet. The report, entitled “Budgetary Performance”, includes a summary table on central government operations on a cash basis and follows the budget classification of receipts and outlays. In addition, there is a Revenue table with detailed breakdown of tax and non-tax revenue. The tables show actual and projected revenue and expenditure data for the months of the quarter as well as a total from the beginning of the financial year through the end of the quarter that it refers to. The tables also contain columns for revised projections for both receipts and outlays. These projections are based on current developments, which may suggest a revision of projections of the immediate past. The MoF prepares, on an annual basis, the budget documents, which include actual revenue and expenditure classified according to budget votes and covers the recurrent budget for past two years. The CPU of the Ministry of Development and Economic planning (MoDEP), on the other hand, prepares the development budget, in consultation with the MoF. 2.4.1 Valuation  Foreign currency transactions are converted into Leones and Cents (the official Currency of Sierra Leone) at the prevailing official exchange rate at the time of the transaction.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Time of Recording: Government revenue and expenditure are recorded on cash basis. Revenue is recorded when collections are made and paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) by the revenue collecting departments, namely the Customs and Excise, Income Tax Departments, and other revenue collecting departments. Expenditure is recorded when cheques are written or payments made from the CRF. There is a commitment control system in operation, but strictly speaking not all commitments are captured, leading to build up of arrears on a limited scale. When arrears are settled, they are recorded below the line rather than as expenditures.  In the case of grants in kind and loans to development projects, the development expenditure is recorded when the goods and services are received.  Closing of Accounts: When the accounts are closed following the end of the year, no more cheques are written for that year. The outstanding exchequer issues at the end of the financial year cease to have effect.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Transactions are generally done on a gross basis, including accounting for government pay as you earn (PAYE). However, certain transactions are netted off such as tax refunds, if any.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical Framework: Central government operations data are organized in accordance with the national budget classification for the central government budget. The data can be used for the analyses of the annual central government budget. The classification of transactions corresponds with A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, IMF, GFS 2014. Data are presented on monthly basis cumulative from the beginning of the year. Central government operations data can be also used for the analyses of the central government influence on the other sectors of the economics as well as analyses of the macroeconomic indicators influence on the central government revenue and expenditure. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Institutional coverage: The central government consists on all central budgetary government units of the Slovak Republic.  Exceptions to coverage  Institutional coverage: The reported data on central government does not include data on institutions that cover social and health insurance, and insurance in unemployment, units responsible for the privatization of the state property (MH Manažment, a. s., Slovak Land Fund), the other state funds, universities, and institutions managed by government, responsible for management of bad claims (Slovak Consolidation Agency), and other general government bodies. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification system: The transmission bridge between the national budgetary classification and classification GFS is used by the compilation of the data. (1) Cash receipts from operating activities Taxes Social contributions Grants Other receipts (2) Cash payments for operating activities: Compensation of employees Purchases of goods and services Interest Subsidies Grants Social benefits Other payments (3) Net cash inflow from operating activities (4) Net cash outflow from operating Purchase of nonfinancial assets Sales of nonfinancial assets (5) Cash surplus / deficit (6) Net acquisition of financial assets other than cash Domestic Foreign (7) Net incurrence of liabilities Domestic Foreign (8) Net cash inflow from financing activities (9) Net change in the stock of cash (10) Statistical discrepancy (11) Memorandum item: Total cash expenditure 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of foreign current transaction: Transactions denominated in the foreign currency are valued at the relevant National bank of Slovakia rate which is accepted on the transaction day.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Accounting basis: The released data are based on data recorded on a cash basis. Complementary period: None.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Adjustments for grossing and netting of transactions: The revenues and expenditures balance does not include transactions recorded on the net basis (except that discounts and refunds taxes are on the net basis). The Act on budgetary rules allows central authorities to engage in commercial activities. These transactions, for departmental enterprises, are not recorded on the revenues or expenditure of the state budget. The profits of their commercial activities are taxed according to The Corporate Income Tax Act and any dividend payments are included in non-tax revenue.",
150,150,151,SVN,Slovenia,2014,2014,2014,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Statistical data is prepared according to the concepts and definitions of GFS2014, thus series of international guidelines on statistical methodologies for the government finance statistic framework is taken into consideration. Used concepts and scope of the data compilation follow also the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA2010) and System of National Accounts (SNA2008). Therefor the published data is consistent and adequate for international comparison.  Results consist of administration data, first of all, for the non-financial account and data from survey on financial accounts statistics for financial components of data on general government operations. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The scope of data is the Statement of Operations, thus one of four financial statements, which is the summary of the transactions of Central government sector in a given reporting period. So details of transaction on revenue and expense, as well as the acquisition minus disposal of fixed assets which equals to net investment to nonfinancial assets plus changes in inventories and net acquisition of valuables and non-produced assets are assessed. The result of this non-financial account must equal the result of financial account, thus net result of transactions in financial assets and liabilities. Calculations are done at a detailed level as stated in GFS2014 manual in appendix 8. Data cover transactions of all institutional units of institutional sector General government (S.13) and some additional specific transaction of funds, which are not institutional units, and rerouted transactions (transactions of SID Bank - government funds, Deposit guarantee fund, transactions of electricity market operator – Borzen). So Central government consist of Budgetary central government (direct budget users) and Extra-budgetary central government units (public funds, public corporations, public agencies, budget reserve fund, state funds, Recovery and resilience fund, State treasury, public institutions, and other units). · Exceptions to coverageNo exceptions. · Unrecorded activity There are no activities that are not covered, from the known facts.  Exceptions to coverage  No exceptions.  Unrecorded activity  There are no activities that are not covered, from the known facts. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Central government is generally divided into State Budget (direct users of the budget) and extra-budgetary units as defined in chapter 2 Institutional units and sectors in GFS2014 manual (Table 2.3), meanwhile the sectorization of individual institutional units is done according to the classification of institutional sectors as defined in ESA2010 methodology – this step is performed in the beginning of processing of statistical data. Further on source data of each individual unit and available transactions is code mapped according to the bridge tables based on the classifications stated in GFS2014 manual in appendix 8. Thus, for the revenue calculations are done at the most detailed level as defined in Table A8.1 Classification of Revenue, while published are the revenues at aggregated level: 11 Taxes, 12 Social contributions, 13 Grants, 14 Other revenue. The same goes with calculation of aggregate expense (stratification in Table A8.2), meanwhile published are main components of expense: 21 Compensation of employees, 22 Use of goods and services, 23 Consumption of fixed capital, 24 Interest, 25 Subsidies, 26 Grants, 27 Social benefits, 28 Other expense. Regarding the Net investment in non-financial assets calculation is done separately for acquisition and disposals of non-financial assets on the level specified in the first part of the Table A8.3. Published are the following components: 311 Fixed assets, 312 Inventories, 313 Valuables, 314 Non-produced assets. Processing of the data on transactions in financial assets and liabilities is done at the level as shown in Table A8.3, separately for domestic and foreign flows. Published is the total Net acquisition of financial assets separately for domestic and foreign economy. 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of a particular component of data set is done mainly according to the GFS2014 manual – depends on the data sources. Regarding the fact that almost all transactions are on cash basis – so in the value at which goods, services, labor, or assets are exchanged or else could be exchanged for cash – valuation is done in current market prices, thus that states for all the flows in Statement of Operations.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The data are recorded on a cash basis for all units, except corporations, where data are at basic prices.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Mainly all the statistical data is presented in line with GFS2014 manual, that states also regarding the gross/net recording transactions in Statement of Operations – that goes especially for non-financial transactions. Based on accounting rules all revenue is presented on a gross basis except taxes as gross amount minus tax refunds, likewise almost all expense categories are presented on a gross basis. Acquisitions and disposals of non-financial assets are presented on gross basis. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities are presented on net basis. Netted / excluded out of the data system are also flows, transaction, which pass the budget, for example EU flows that have been used up, have been spent in sectors other than General government and must not affect the balancing item net operating balance and net lending/net borrowing (B.9), thus these transaction are eliminated from revenue (Grants) and from expense (Subsidies). An example of these is complex subsidies to agriculture financed from EU budget for the implementation of the common agricultural and fisheries policy. In this case a discrepancy in netting of these flows exist – time lag of approximately two months when funds are transferred to beneficiaries (recorded as expense - subsidies) and when it is established by the EU, that these funds have been justified and rightly spent (recorded as revenue - grants). Hereby the records on expense side are more reliable, therefore Recordings on the revenue side are adjusted based on the elimination of recordings on the expense side, thus there is no effect on balancing item, but consequently negative values may be presented on the revenue side at component Grants. By statistical process of data proper step by step intra-consolidation is performed. Firstly, intra-sectoral consolidation is done at a level of extra-budgetary units by a group of units / consolidation of flows within the units in a group: corporations, public funds, public institutions..., and further on, among these groups of units / consolidation of flows among groups of units, which are already consolidated in a group. Further on second intra-sectoral consolidation between Budgetary central government (direct budget users) and Extra-budgetary central government units. Double counting is checked and done 1:1 between the observed units which have intra flows, thus they are identified by both. In other cases, the most reliable records of flows of one unit is taken in consideration and then inputted/corrected by the other unit. There are no statistical errors or statistical discrepancies closed at this procedure. Each individual eliminated transaction through consolidation can be found in the system on both sides.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical framework: The methodology used for the compilation of non-financial data of Central Government is that established by the ESA 2010 (EU Council Regulation 549/2013) and by the Manual on Government Deficit and Debt. Published data refer to the total amount of non-financial revenue and expenditure, non-financial operations balance (net lending/net borrowing) and interest expenditure, calculated following the classifications, definitions and accounting rules of the above mentioned ESA 2010. It also follows the Commission Regulation (EU) 220/2014 amending EU Council Regulation 479/2009. Financial operations (change in financial assets and financing) are elaborated in the framework of the ESA 2010 (EU Council Regulation 549/2013). It includes the change in financial assets and financing broken down by instrument and counterpart holder following the classification, definitions, and rules of accounting contained in the above mentioned ESA 2010. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Data of nonfinancial operations refer to the operations of that kind from the Central Government (State), defined following ESA2010. It is included the total amount of nonfinancial Revenue and Expenditure, net balance (deficit (-) /surplus) and details for the components or resources and uses (interest and the rest of the categories). The data on financial operations cover the change in financial assets and liabilities for the State including a breakdown by counterpart sector.  Exceptions to coverage  The data exclude the central government agencies and the social security funds. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The Technical National Accounts Committee (CTCN), created by Organic Law 6/2013 and make up by representatives of the National Statistics Institute (INE), the Banco de España and the Audit Office (IGAE), is responsible for the sectoral delimitation of public sector units based on the standards of the European System of Accounts. The existence and functioning of the CTCN ensures coordination of three institutions (Banco de España, INE and IGAE) involved in the compilation of statistics. The data are divided into: ""Nonfinancial operations"", including data on: revenue; expenditure; and the balance (deficit/surplus). ""Financial operations"", including the change in financial assets and liabilities distinguishing between foreign and domestic sectors, with a further bank/non-bank breakdown for domestic financing. 2.4.1 Valuation  For non-financial operations, the valuations methods are according to ESA 2010 rules. The general approach is the market value. However, the non-market output of general government is measured by the production costs. For financial operations, the following valuation methods are applicable, in general: Debt securities, actual transactions value plus accrued interest; Equity and Investment fund shares and equities in Euros, effective transactions value; and Instruments in foreign currency, effective transaction value in Euros, calculated using exchange rate at the respective placement or redemption dates.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Nonfinancial operations are registered on an accrual basis in the terms included in the SEC 2010 and taking into account the practical application of this principal to specific operations considered in the SEC 2010 instructions, related to debt and public deficit.

The Bank of Sudan also disseminates data on central government operations as part of the annual report of the Bank of Sudan. The definitions of aggregates broadly follow the recommendations of the IMF Manual on Government Finance Statistics 1986, except that (i) foreign grants are classified as financing items, (ii) all foreign debt service payments are classified as current expenditure, and (iii) all domestic debt service payments are classified as domestic financing. Data are presented in millions of Sudanese dinars. Revenue is defined as the nonrepayable receipts of government, and consists of tax and nontax revenue. Foreign grants are classified as part of foreign finance, rather than as deficit determining transactions. Expenditure consists of nonrepayable outlays, except that all foreign debt service (including both interest and repayment) is classified as expenditure, and all domestic debt service is classified as financing. The treatment of foreign debt service is based on the fact that much of the debt service is on rescheduled loans for which periodic lump-sum payments are made. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage: The entire country of Sudan.

164,164,165,SYR,Syrian Arab Republic,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Planning and Statistics Directorate (PSD) at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) compiles government finance statistics (GFS) broadly based on the analytical framework, as much as possible, on the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual of 1986 (GFSM86) and on the classifications suggested by the IMF. The compilation is done based on harmonization of the classifications used in the fiscal budget and the classification used in preparing the GFS for both revenue and expenditure. The PSD is charged with a responsibility for compiling the GFS based on the closing accounts of actual fiscal data. The following sets of tables are prepared: A brief statement of the government finance, as follows: Total revenue Oil revenue Non-oil tax revenue Non-oil non-tax revenue (other revenue) Gross expenditure Current government expenditure including internal and external debt payments Government expenditure on investment External grants Overall deficit or surplus Overall financing External financing Domestic financing Government revenue, presented in a more detailed breakdown; Government expenditure, presented in a more detailed breakdown; Investment revenue (revenue received from those public sector corporations with surplus in a detailed breakdown); A statement on revenue and expenditure of the Price Stabilization Fund; Government external debt in million of USD. The GFS data are compiled annually in millions of Syrian pounds. The data, however, are not published by the MOF but are provided to certain government agencies on request and to Arab and international organizations on their request (after being approved by a special Committee on external data dissemination that reports to the CBStat). Detailed annual GFS data are published by the Central Bank of Syria(CBS) in its Quarterly Bulletin in a table called Actual Operations of the General Budget. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The actual fiscal budget execution data, which are the source data for the GFS, cover all revenues and expenditures of the following units: All ministries and general directorates; Public units of an administrative nature (that perform administrative tasks) except for the Directorates under the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Data of these directorates are recorded on a net basis, i.e. only the net revenue/net expenditure of these units is reflected in the budget data. Revenues and expenditures of institutional units of an economic nature (public corporations) and local administrative units are also recorded on a net basis, i.e. only the net revenue/net expenditure of these units is reflected in the budget data.  Unrecorded activity 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The classifications used by the PSD are broadly based on the GFSM86. New classification system and its guide based on the GFSM2001 methodology have been prepared and presented to the respective officials in the MOF for comments. This is the first step towards adopting the GFSM2001 classifications. The GFS data disseminated by the Central Bank of Syria are presented as follows: Revenue Oil-Related Proceeds Profit Tax on the Syrian Petroleum Company (SPC) Royalties Petroleum Products Surcharges Surplus from SPC Non-Oil Tax Revenue Income and Profits Excises International Trade Other Non-Oil Non-Tax Revenue Expenditures Current Expenditures Wages and Salaries Goods and Services Interest Payments Subsidies and Transfers Development Expenditures Social Sector Agriculture Extractive Industries Manufacturing Industries Utilities Construction Trade Transportation and Communication Finance Other Sectors Foreign Grants Budget Balance (excluding PSF) Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) Balance Overall Balance (including PSF) Financing External Domestic The source for these data is the MOF. 2.4.2 Recording basis  The accounting of government operations is cash based, as all transactions are valued on the basis of the amounts actually received for revenues and actually paid for expenditures.The budget year is the fiscal year; it starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 of every year. The project of the modernization of the MOF in cooperation with the EU has lead to the following improvements: - The present budget classification system has been examined and a draft of the new budget classification system has been finalized (the new system includes administrative, geographical, services, and economic classifications). - Automation set up for the new classification system has been launched. - The new classification system and its guide have been presented to the officials in the MOF for comments. This is the first step towards adopting the new classification system (a medium-term plan). - Staff members have received training on preparing the budget, the required templates, forms, and using computer programs. - The technical description of the Government Finance Management Information System (GFMIS) has been prepared.

166,166,167,TZA,Tanzania,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Analytical Framework, Concepts and Definitions  Tanzania mainland’s central government operations data are compiled and disseminated by the Policy Analysis Department (PAD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) through Quarterly Parliamentary reports, Budget Execution reports, Quarterly Public Debt reports and bi-annual General Budget Support Reports. These data are also disseminated through Bank of Tanzania’s (BoT) monthly economic review, quarterly Economic Bulletin, Annual Economic and Operations Reports and on the website. Comprehensive data for the central government operations that cover all units of government are not currently compiled, as operations of the extra-budgetary units and funds are excluded from these figures. With the increasing role of the local government in priority expenditure, there is a need to compile and monitor data for the whole of general government (see section II below for encouraged extension).  Annual and monthly data are compiled by the PAD from reports of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Accountant General Department (AGD), the BoT, and the Treasury--data provided by the Treasury (Principal Accountant's Treasury's Office) includes those collected from ministries, regions, and parastatals.  The MOF's analytical presentation of central government operations is consistent with the statistical framework set out in the IMF's ""Manual of Government Finance Statistics (GFS)"" (1986) except for net lending line item (lending minus repayments), the inclusion of grants in kind, and the classification of payments of expenditure arrears to suppliers. Although central government operations table shows a line item for net lending, no data is available for this item. The government does not lend to public financial enterprises but it lends and receives repayments of loans extended to government employees, it also acquires and sells equity of public enterprises, and subscribes quotas to international organizations. Consequently, revenue comprises non-repayable government receipts other than grants and repayment of loans extended by the government (imprests). Grants comprise unrequited, non-repayable, and noncompulsory receipts in cash and in kind. Expenditures comprise government non-repayable payments, small amounts of acquisition in equity of enterprises or quota subscriptions to international organizations, and government lending to employees. Payments of expenditure in arrears are recorded below the line in an item called change in arrears and not as expenditure. The transfer to the budget from net proceeds of the privatization fund is separately recorded below the line as Privatization receipts within domestic financing. Total bank and non-bank financing covers all government financing (government securities, loans, and advances minus deposits). Bank financing is calculated as net claims of the banking system on all central government units (budgetary and extra-budgetary units) and non-bank financing is calculated as a residual. Domestic financing includes some adjustments made for the monitoring of the financial program. There is an adjustment to the overall deficit that takes into account the revenue and expenditure float and errors and omissions. Coverage  The MOF's analytical presentation of central government operations is in general accordance with the statistical framework set out in the IMF's Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986 (GFSM), except for the classification of lending minus repayments operations, the inclusion of grants in kind, and the classification of payments of expenditure arrears to suppliers below the line. Interest payments on domestic debt and foreign debt are separately identified. The fiscal year is July–June. See GDDS Table A on Central Government Operations for the description of the comprehensive framework. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage  Development budget operations that are partly externally financed through direct purchase of goods and services have incomplete coverage on the monthly statement of central government operations compiled by the MOF with a one month lag. The coverage improves for annual data, compiled with two or three months lag. In addition, there may be some grants in kind to government units that are not captured in the budget.  Geographic Coverage  See above  Unit Coverage  Central government operations:  The government data cover the operations of the central government units covered by the recurrent and development budgets. These units comprise the various central institutions, line ministries, regions, and various commissions and offices. In the recurrent budget, only transfers to special funds and extra-budgetary units at the central government level are recorded but not all the operations of these units and funds. Social security benefits (health and pensions) are provided through various autonomous units funded by the contributions of employees and employers. Central government data do not cover these funds.  The Zanzibar government has autonomy with respect to all matters not covered by the Union; data on Zanzibar government operations are separately compiled. Budgetary central government data (for mainland Tanzania) include only transfers to Zanzibar but not union taxes collected in Zanzibar. Besides the central government Zanzibar has local government and non-union parastatals (public enterprises).  General government operations (encouraged extension):  Besides the central government units, there are urban district councils in Tanzania mainland that constitute the local government. Currently data for these units are not consolidated into a general government statement. The central government operations statement includes transfers to the local government.  Urban and district councils in the mainland are accountable to the Prime Ministers’ Office—Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG). There is no system established for these units to report their operations to a central unit, such as the MOF, that will consolidate them to generate a general government consolidated statement. Urban and district councils use different classification systems to that of the central government budget to classify their operations, and follow a calendar year instead of the July-June fiscal year.  Coverage  Monthly data on the operations of the recurrent and development budgets of the government of Tanzania (refers to Tanzania mainland only) are compiled and disseminated by the Policy Analysis Department (PAD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in the table Central Government Operations, quarterly fiscal performance is reported in the budget execution report and Parliamentary report on budget performance. These data are disseminated bi-annually in the PAD's report Poverty Reduction Budget Support During the Quarter prepared for the Poverty Reduction Budget Support and on the National Website and MOF website and for the Parliament. The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) disseminates these same data in its various publications, but with different periodicity: the monthly data are disseminated on the BoT's website, the quarterly data are published in the Economic Bulletin and the annual data are published in the Economic and Operations Report for the Year. Unrecorded activity  Unrecorded Activity (as relevant)  None 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Classification System  MOF's central government operations analytical table includes a summarized classification for all major aggregates. In the analytical table tax revenue is classified by main tax while non-tax revenue identifies parastatals' (public enterprises) dividends and non-tax income collected by the Treasury or ministries or regions.  Expenditures by major economic classification are first disaggregated into recurrent and development expenditure based on the budget. Although all recurrent expenditure is current expenditure, some current expenditure may be included in the development budget. Recurrent expenditure distinguishes wages and salaries, interest payments, and goods and services and transfers. However, wages and salaries include those wages and salaries of local governments incorporated in the budget (these are a type of transfer from the central government to the local government). Other goods and services and transfers show a detail of spending, but there is no functional breakdown of all expenditures.  As described above, lending minus repayments is not separately identified.  Financing is classified by residence. Foreign financing shows total disbursements and amortization and domestic financing is classified by creditor showing bank and non-bank financing. As mentioned above, domestic financing also includes the privatization fund net proceeds as well as the change in expenditure arrears. Supplemental information: On a monthly basis, the TRA prepares a ""Tax Revenue Report"" (flash report) disseminating the actual collections by major tax revenue collection departments and type of taxes. This report also presents the actual collections of Union taxes in Zanzibar. Additionally, on a monthly basis, the TRA disseminates a very detailed statement of ""Actual Monthly Collection Statement"" (for mainland Tanzania).  On a quarterly basis, the MOF's reports on Macro-fiscal Developments by tables. These tables contain monthly and quarterly data. The revenue table shows total revenues with a more detailed disaggregation of major taxes (income tax, customs duties, excises and value added tax) classified further according to the tax base. This table is compiled by the TRA and shows slight differences with total revenue in the analytical table. The expenditure table covers only recurrent expenditure and provides a breakdown by budget vote of wages and salaries and other charges, compiled from the AGD's report on exchequer issues.  On a quarterly basis, the MOF prepares a quarterly report for the Parliament (in Swahili) entitled ""Review of the Budget Performance for the Quarter and the Likely Outturn""and quarterly Budget Execution Report. These reports include a summary table on central government operations on a cash basis following the budget grouping of receipts and outlays. In addition there is a Revenue table with detailed breakdown of tax and non-tax revenue. The tables show actual and projected data for the months of the quarter analyzed, as well as a total for the quarter and a total from the beginning of the fiscal year through the end of the quarter that it refers to. Besides these two tables with actual data, there is a revised projection for the receipts and outlays for the fiscal year.  On an annual basis, the MOF prepares the budget documents, which include actual revenue and expenditure classified according to budget votes and covers both the recurrent and development budgets.  Zanzibar On a quarterly basis, the BoT compiles and disseminates in its ""Economic Bulletin"" an analytical table on Zanzibar's government operations using information from the Zanzibar Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, the BoT, and People's Bank of Zanzibar (PBZ). Operations of the extra-budgetary units and funds in Zanzibar are not covered. Unlike the framework described above for mainland Tanzania, these data cover only cash transactions of the recurrent and development budgets of Zanzibar.  Revenues and expenditures are recorded when cash is received or when cash is paid. Revenue data cover both Union taxes collected through TRA and non-union taxes and non-tax revenue collected through the Zanzibar Revenue Board. Non-tax revenue includes transfers made by the Union government to Zanzibar for BoT's dividends and balance of payments support.  Expenditure data only cover payments made from the revenue collections. Development budget expenditures financed by grants and loans from abroad are not covered. Financing data is all classified as domestic bank and non-bank financing. Transactions from foreign grants and loans are not currently recorded. 2.4.1 Valuation  III. Accounting Conventions  Valuation methods:  Transactions in foreign currency are converted at the market exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction.  2.4.2 Recording basis  III. Accounting Conventions  Time of recording:  Data for central government operations are basically recorded on a cash basis. Revenue is recorded when collections are made by the TRA; other non-tax income not channeled through the TRA are recorded when cash or checks are deposited. Expenditure is recorded when checks are written or payments are made. In the case of grants and loans in kind to development projects, the development expenditure is recorded when goods and services are received.  Closing of accounts:  The closing of the accounts at the end of the fiscal year implies that no more checks are written for the year. The outstanding exchequer issues at the end of the fiscal year cease to have effect.  The annual accounts are prepared by the AGD four months after the end of the fiscal year and the audited accounts are available five months after. This brings the availability of audited data to nine months after the end of the fiscal year. These audited data are not currently being used by PAD to revise the central government operations analytical table because they are not yet available with the classification breakdown required. Once all data is integrated in the IFMS system it is expected that final AGD data will have the necessary detail to update the central government operations analytical table. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  V. Compilation Practices  Adjustments for grossing and netting:  All transactions are recorded on a gross basis, except for tax refunds which are netted against revenue. Operations of departmental enterprises such as the printing office are recorded on a gross basis.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The detailed central government data are compiled in accordance with the statistical framework defined in the 1986 edition of the IMF's ""A Manual on Government Finance Statistics."" Within the framework of budget execution in Togo: (a) revenue constitutes nonrepayable receipts by government; (b) expenditure includes nonfinancial government obligations and financial operations executed for general policy purposes (onlending, loans to public enterprises); and (c) financing covers financial operations executed for liquidity management purposes (interest on placements with banks, etc.). The budget execution table shows the following detailed classifications: Revenue by type: tax revenue (direct and indirect taxation), nontax revenue (budgetary and nonbudgetary) the latter being essentially the net receipts of autonomous government agencies; Functional classification of expenditure: Current expenditure (operating expenditure and interest on the public debt) and capital expenditure by source of financing: project loans and project grants. Data on the domestic debt are not yet classified by type of instrument and debt holder because the new public debt management system is not yet properly implemented. The budget is made available to the spending ministries. Those who wish to read it may obtain it from the Budget Directorate. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The data cover the operations of central government, which includes ministries and units, as well as the annexed funds and special accounts. Data include Togolese embassies and legal representations. All the operations of the aforementioned units are recorded in the Treasury accounts through the document entitled ""Treasury Account Trial Balance,"" compiled every month for general budgetary operations (this document is not published). The data on the annexed budgets and special accounts and funds are submitted by the Directorate-General of the Treasury and Government Accounting (Treasury). All data relating to the special accounts are tracked in the Treasury Account Trial Balance.  Unrecorded activity  National Social Security Fund (CNSS) operations and transactions in kind are not recorded in the state budget unless the donor required that their counterpart financial value be established and confirmed. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Total revenue, which includes: Budgeted tax revenue paid by the Togolese Revenue Office (Tax Directorate and Customs Directorate, and the Customs and Indirect Tax Office; budgeted tax revenue collected by the Directorate General of the Treasury and Public Accounting (DGTCP) and grants. Current expenditure and net lending or lending minus repayments, covers: Personnel expenditure Supplies and equipment Transfers and subsidies Other current expenditure: Interest payments on the debt (domestic and external) Extra-budgetary current expenditure: Special accounts Net lending or lending minus repayments. Investment expenditure or capital expenditure by sources of external financing (grants and loans) and on domestic financing. Different Balances: Primary balance Current primary balance Current balance Basic budget balance Overall balance, excluding grants Overall balance, including grants 2.4.2 Recording basis  Government operations are recorded on a cash basis during the period in which they are actually executed and not during the fiscal year in which they were authorized. Indeed, if imputing operations to their original budget offers advantages in terms of legislative control and effective management, it is necessary, for economic analysis, to impute them to the period during which they were executed in order to ascertain their interaction with the other macroeconomic aggregates during that period. This is why adjustments are made to exclude from fiscal year operations those that correspond to the supplementary period and to include those that correspond to the supplementary period of the previous year.  2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Revenue is posted on the basis of gross receipts. These gross accounting data are given a different treatment in the following cases: Taxes are considered net of refunds, In cases of exceptional netting, the amount of these operations is excluded, so as not to be reflected in future revenue projections. Current and capital expenditure is recorded gross on a payment order basis, except for the operating expenditure of market production units or autonomous agencies, which are recorded net in the budgetary accounts. Expenditure payable without prior payment orders (legal fees, for example) is recorded on the payment due date..",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Data are compiled according to the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual, 1986 (GFSM86) and cover operations of budgetary central government). Currently data do not cover the activities of public enterprises, so these activities are not included; however lending by government to public enterprises is reflected in the lending minus repayments category. Public enterprises are now operating under the Public Enterprise Act (2002) with the PE unit at MOF monitoring their operations. Lending minus repayments is treated as an above-the-line item for purposes of deficit calculation. Government operations are recorded on a cash basis. Provisional data are compiled on a monthly basis for policy purpose and internal use only. Provisional data for the first six months of FY is reported in the Half Yearly Budget Review at the end of March every year. Annual data are published in the Budget Statement prepared by the Ministry of Finance. All fiscal data are reported and assessed by the IMF during its annual Article IV mission. Data are derived from revenue and expenditure reports submitted to the MOF Treasury Department. Data are revised as final audited budget account data are available. The latest audited a/c to date is for FY2002/03. Treasury has indicated that audited accounts for 2003/04 & 2004/05 are targeted to be completed by year end June 2006. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The entire country is covered. Data cover all budgetary cash transactions and activities related to the government retirement scheme. There are no local governments in Tonga. Unrecorded activity  Data do not include grants in-kind. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  As stated above, the classification follows the GFSM86. Accordingly, aggregates compiled and disseminated include: Revenue: i.e. tax, non-tax, current, capital and grants Expenditure: current, capital, and by economic type. Lending minus repayments Overall deficit/surplus Financing: domestic and foreign Data do not include grants in-kind. Data on classification of expenditure by government function is currently in the process of being compiled. In the past, treatment of activities related to the Tonga Trust Fund were classified as grants.

171,171,172,TTO,Trinidad and Tobago,1986,1986,1986,"2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Published data of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, with adjustments provided by the MOF, generally conform to recommendations of the IMF’s A Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM) 1986. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage: The entire country is covered. Transaction Coverage: All transactions of the central government are included. Unit Coverage: The data cover the budgetary position of Central Government only, comprising the following units: Audit, cabinet, governorate, house of assembly, judiciary, ministries, senate, and service commissions. Data also include budgetary social security and extrabudgetary accounts. Among the adjustments made are: Emolument bonds issued beginning in 1995 to settle debt to public sector employees. The bonds, which were issued tax-free and were non-interest bearing, were included in current expenditures. Payments related to these bonds were concluded in the IIIQ of 1999; Domestic loans granted by commercial banks for project financing facilities are excluded when they are part of design, finance and construct arrangement. The facilities are classified under Capital expenditure. Upon completion of the project, a debt liability is created; The central government contracted loans from the IADB and the EIB which were onlent to Petrotrin, a state enterprise in the energy sector. Repayment of these loans are made by the state enterprise to the creditors via the central government. As a result repayment of these loans are excluded from the line item ‘External Financing-Repayments’ in the central government’s fiscal accounts. The category ‘Repayment of past lending,’ which covers the contingent liabilities noted above, are included as a revenue item in MOF data, but are netted from expenditures in CBTT data; and The MOF data include privatization (divestment) proceeds as capital revenue, but these are shown as below the line financing in CBTT data. Transfers to the Interim Revenue Stabilisation Fund are included by the MOF in expenditure. CBTT excludes these transfers from expenditure since they are not actual expenditure.  Unrecorded activity 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The data on central government aggregrates are compiled by a mixture of cash and accruals, presented in millions of TT dollars. The classification is as follows: Revenue, with a breakdown by: type of tax revenue (property, services, business & professional, motor vehicle, departure, international trade and transactions); non-tax revenue (including income, fines, forfeits and administrative fees, sale of Government Property, other and grants). Current Expenditure, classified by economic and functional categories. capital Expenditure, classified by economic and functional categories. Net lending. Surplus/deficit. Financing (external and domestic) – broken down by local and foreign currency, by instrument, and by maturity. 2.4.1 Valuation  The net borrowing transactions are recorded at the price of the transactions, which is market price.  2.4.2 Recording basis  For receipts, the data are compiled on the basis of cash and checks received, and for payments, cash paid and checks issued. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  Entries are generally recorded on a gross basis. There are several exception, e.g., tax refunds are subtracted from tax receipts in the compilation of reported taxes.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  On April 11, 2010 the cabinet issued Ministerial decree number (67/5w/1) to support MOF efforts in gathering and Compiling UAE Federal and Emirate government’s financial data and present UAE combined financials as per IMF – GFS 2001 standards and guidelines. The sophistication of accounting systems varies across the Federal government and the Emirates, the Federal government and the Emirates manages financial records for the budgetary entities while some finance departments also collect data from their extra budgetary entities. The recording system is mainly cash for receipts and varies from cash to noncash for payments across the general government entities.  The Federal Government has an automated accounting system (Financial Management Information System (FMIS), an Oracle system) for all budgetary accounts. All the transactions are channeled through the Treasury Single Account, using uniform chart of accounts. They have developed an in-house automated reporting and processing system for the GFS and established a front level integrated system for primary data providers to upload on the MOF’s database. All extra budgetary entities have established an interface to this system for uploading to the MOF, primary data that is already bridged to the MOF codes.  As most of the government expenditures in the U.A.E. occur at the Emirate rather than federal government level, it is necessary to capture the Emirates’ government accounting activity to accurately generate consolidated general government GFS. The FPCD of the MOF, in its effort to collect government accounting data from the Emirates, was tasked with developing an electronic system to allow the Emirates to transmit these data to the MOF system for the compilation of consolidated general government GFS. The MOF established the following goals for the system: (i) accurate and timely data collection, (ii) secure data transmission, (iii) minimal errors, and (iv) a single database for storing all accounting data, both the Federal Government and the Emirates. The Federal Government (MOF) is using chart of accounts (COA) differs from that one used by each Emirate separately, but each of the seven emirates in addition to MOF preparing the classification and derivation tables to prepare the data according to GFSM analytical framework to be able to combine together. Some emirates currently using the Accrual basis of accounting, and some have plan for transforming from cash to accrual basis of accounting according to the recommendations of GFSM 2014. However currently MOF collecting GFS data according to GFSM2014 analytical framework. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Unit Coverage The Central Government: according to articles 45 and 47 of the enacted Constitution of the UAE, there is a group of federal authorities, highest of most is the Federal Supreme Council (FSC) that oversees the general policy in all invested matters in the Federation, endorse different federal laws, inclusive general fiscal budget laws, Federation accounting balances, and other legislations and special laws throughout the Emirates. In addition to setting legislations, constitution articles, and distribution of authorities as per existing sectors of the Government Finance Statistics manual, issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), so that the Federal Government is considered to be the Central Government, as the Federal Government provide services throughout the State and has the authority to impose fees or taxation throughout State constituencies. The Central Government is divided into three major components, according to sector-based classification: Budgetary Central Government: the Central Government within the budget is composed of a central group of ministries working within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government funded by the General Government Budget. Central Government data has been fully covered. Extra-Budgetary Central Government: this is composed of institutional units working under the jurisdictions of the Federal Government; established under federal decrees with an autonomous legal status with a certain degree of independence, particularly administrative and financial independence. The functions are geared to help and assist ministries and Federal Government institutions in carrying out their policies and programs, so that most of its funding is dependent on grants, and self /sustainable income and fees. In the event this Central Government would face a budget deficit or surplus, it will be transferred to or funded by the General Treasury. All of its data is regularly covered. Social security funds: the UAE General Pension and Social Security Authority (GPSSA) manage this federal social security program, which is an independent body and operated apart from the Central Government. GPSSA data is collected and compiled. Additionally, there are pension funds and special pension reward systems, especially for the Government employees of the Government of Abu Dhabi, for which the data has not been collected. The state Government (Emirates Governments): this includes the seven Emirates, whether in or outside the budget. Currently, the entire Emirates’ Government budgetary data has been collected and compiled, in addition to some extra Budgetary data. Worth mentioning that the comprehensiveness the data collection is limited to General Government data at the UAE level, which do not include public sector data that represent the data of profitable companies owned or controlled by the Government. Transaction Coverage All monetary transactions of the Central government and the Emirate Governments are covered by the GFS, meaning that any transaction not having a monetary effect will be excluded, such as in kind transaction.  Geographic Coverage The GFS cover all territories under the control of the UAE Authority. Meanwhile each Emirate is responsible for its own data while MOF is responsible for the federal data. The Federal Government has political authority on the UAE but doesn’t have a defined geographic territory.  Exceptions to coverage  No missing entities on central government level Unrecorded activity  Activities and transaction for all uncovered units. See (2.2.1.2) 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  According to the data compiled for the previous years for the federal and the Seven Emirates, the data fully consistence with GFSM 2014 standards. The data include the following tables for all government levels: Table 1: The Revenues table as in GFSM standards which include the four categories for the revenues (Taxes, Social contributions, Grants, and other revenues) with their details.  Table 2: The Economic classification of Expenses as in GFSM standards which include the eight categories for the expenses (Compensation of employees, Use of goods and services, Consumption of fixed capital, Interest, Subsidies, Grants, Social benefits, and Other expense) with their details.  Table 3: Transaction in Assets and liabilities which have all available details about financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities.  Table 7: Outlays by function of the government this table was filled based on GFSM standards for all government levels. 2.4.1 Valuation  Stocks are valued on the basis of historical prices as in the accounting books except for investments which are valued at fair market value.  Transactions in foreign currency are converted to U.A.E. Dirham using the market exchange rates prevailed on the date of transaction.  Balances in foreign currency are translated into UAE Dirham at the prevailing rates at year end, any translation gains or losses are recorded accordingly.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Data are compiled on modified cash basis for MOF and the Seven Emirates except Dubai and Ajman that used accrual accounting. Most of the emirates have plan for transforming from cash to accrual basis of accounting according to the recommendations of GFSM 2004. 2.4.3 Grossing/netting procedures  All transactions are recorded on net basis, refund revenues and expenses recorded in contra entry. Extend the coverage of GFS data to cover all budgetary and extra- budgetary units for all Emirates. Transform to accrual accounting basis the federal government and most of the emirates.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces the UK National Accounts on an internationally comparable basis, in accordance with the System of National Accounts 2008: SNA 2008 and the European System of Accounts 2010: ESA 2010. The methodology used for the compilation of non-financial accounts of general government (revenue, expenditure, and net lending/net borrowing) and of net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities is based on the ESA 2010 and the Eurostat Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction coverage: The production boundary is in accordance with the ESA 2010.Geographic coverage: Great Britain and Northern Ireland, excluding the offshore islands (the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).Institutional coverage of central government in reported data: Data cover all central government units including the National Insurance Fund. Furthermore, central government extra budgetary funds are not distinguished from central government budgetary funds.Central government is a sector in national accounts as defined by ESA2010. It comprises Parliament; government departments and their executive agencies; the devolved assemblies of Scotland and Wales; Northern Ireland departments; government funds such as the National Loans Fund; the foreign exchange official reserves; non-departmental public bodies; and various other public bodies that are controlled and mainly financed by central government. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  The general government sector and its sub-sectors are defined in accordance with the regulations of ESA 2010 and the rules and clarifications provided in the Eurostat's Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD), which are also consistent with the 2008 SNA and GFSM 2014. The UK general government sector consists of the central government and local government. The Office for National Statistics compiles and disseminates government finance statistics for each sub-sector as well as for the general government sector. The ONS economic statistics classifications process is used to determine which units belong within the government sector and which transactions are taxes.  https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/economicstatisticsclassific ations/ukeconomicstatisticssectorandtransactionclassificationstheclassificationprocess 2.4.1 Valuation  Valuation of transactions: Transactions are valued in accordance with ESA 2010. Transactions denominated in foreign currency are converted to £ Sterling by using prevailing market rates.  2.4.2 Recording basis  Data on non-financial and financial transactions of general government are recorded in line with ESA 2010, i.e. the principal of accruals recording is applied. The data for central government are based on actual accounting records.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  The fiscal information prepared by the Government Finance Statistics Office (OEFP) of the Ministry of Finance (MF) for the Budgetary Central Government (GCP) is elaborated in a monthly and quarterly form, based on the IMF 1986 Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM), publisher by the international Monetary Fund (IMF). All the concepts used in the compilation of data on GCP operations are based generally on the GFSM, with the exception of extra budgetary expenditure, which is financed by external loans received from (disbursed by) multilateral and bilateral institutions and suppliers abroad, which may be received either in cash or in goods and services for current or capital consumption, recorded as extra budgetary expenditure above the line and as an external disbursement under financing. The compiled data are presented in the form of a table on the financial performance of each component of the SPR, as well as in consolidated form. The table on the GCP uses the following classification: Total revenue Current revenue Tax revenue Oil Non-oil Non-tax revenue Oil Non-oil Revenue from transfers Capital revenue Expenditure and lending minus repayments Current expenditure (operating expenditure, interest and charges on the public debt, and transfer expenditure) Capital expenditure (gross capital formation, transfers to government bodies, and transfers to the private sector) Extrabudgetary expenditure (current and capital) Lending minus repayments Primary surplus (+) or deficit (-) Current surplus (+) or deficit (-) Non-oil surplus (+) or deficit (-) Financial surplus (+) or deficit (-) Financing Domestic  Central Bank  Rest of financial system  Disbursements  Amortization  Redemption/refinancing  Net placements of securities  Other  Other domestic External Disbursements Amortization Redemption/refinancing FIEM [Investment Fund for Macroeconomic Stabilization] Other The data also include transfers to regional governments, decentralized entities, the social security system, nonfinancial public enterprises, and nonbank public financial institutions. The fiscal year for the statistics is the calendar year. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Geographic Coverage: GCP operations may be carried out in any location in the national territory. These operations include, as transfer expenditure, the resources in the revenue sharing system for governors' and mayors' offices, as well as other current and capital transfers to these regional bodies. Transaction Coverage: The cash operations of the GCP are adjusted to include: 1. the external disbursements of multilateral and bilateral institutions and external suppliers as extrabudgetary current and capital expenditure: 2. the earmarked revenue from the customs service fee for the Integrated National Tax Administration Services (SENIAT); 3. the gasoline subsidy paid to the Urban Transport Fund (FONTUR) by Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA); this operation is reflected in GCP operations as the receipt of petroleum taxes and a transfer expenditure to FONTUR; 4. disbursements effected through trusts managed by the Economic and Social Development Bank (BANDES); 5. the quasifiscal losses of the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV), must be reported as a memorandum item only; 6. payments made by the GCP on the indirect debt; 7. the amount corresponding to Tax Refund Certificates (CERTs) is reported as a memorandum item only. Unit Coverage: The data include the budgetary accounts of the twenty-seven (27) institutional organizations making up the budgetary central government (GCP). Information is also available on the Decentralized Administrative Agencies (including Social Security Institutions) making up the GCP. Data on the SPR include, in consolidated form, the following components: GCP, Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS), Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), a sample of non-oil nonfinancial public enterprises the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund (FOGADE), and the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV) only until May 2001. The data above the line and the change in deposits are derived from the accounting records of the National Treasury Office (ONT), and the remaining data below the line (financing) are derived from the accounting records of the the National Public Credit Office(ONCP).  Unrecorded activity  GCP operations include only current and capital transfers to the decentralized entities of the GCP. The complete operations of these entities should be consolidated with GCP operations in order to obtain data on the central government of Venezuela as recommended by the ""GFSM"". 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  Detailed GCP data are compiled in monthly, quarterly, and annual form in accordance with the following classifications: 1. current tax revenue classified by type of tax; 2. current nontax revenue classified by category; 3. total expenditure classified by economic type; these are also published separately; 4. fiscal revenue in cash classified as ordinary and extraordinary; 5. fiscal expenditure classified as ordinary and extraordinary; 6. total expenditure by object of expenditure; 7. total expenditure by institutional sector; 8. total expenditure by function; 9. current and capital transfers to the decentralized entities and institutions of the social security system making up the central government, as well as to governors' and mayors' offices and public enterprises. 2.4.1 Valuation  External debt service is recorded in domestic currency at the exchange rate applicable at the time of each operation. 2.4.2 Recording basis  The data on GCP transactions are recorded on a cash basis, in millions of bolívares. Expenditure is recorded on the basis of payments made through the record of payment orders settled by the National Treasury Office (OTN). Revenue is recorded in terms of cash values (checks and cash effectively received). The data on the rest of the public sector as narrowly defined are also converted on a cash basis, and presented separately, with intrasectoral and intersectoral operations being eliminated during the consolidation.",
185,185,186,VNM,Vietnam,1986,1986,1986,"2. Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  From 2017, budget management has been implemented in accordance with State Budget Law 2015, whereby the concept, scope, budget revenues and expenditures are closer to international practice. Data on budgetary activities of the Vietnamese Government (state budget) prepared by the State Budget Department - MOF. This data neither include the activities of off-budget funds, nor the sale of budgets through SOEs (the State does not fund SOEs); Budget management panels: A set of preliminary tables on monthly, quarterly and annually state budget implementation prepared by the State Budget Department based on reports from State Treasury; General Department of Customs; General Department of Taxation; Department of Debt Management and External Finance The framework for managing budgets and budget deficits are calculated as revenues (taxes, fees, grants) minus expenditures (payments and interest). Offsets for budget deficits are domestic and foreign borrowings (excluding loans for re-lending). Loans to offset state budget deficit will only be used for development investment expenditure and not used for regular expenditure. Data tables provided to international organizations and donors: The quarterly, annual data tables compiled by the Department of State Budget. These sets of data tables are in line with international standards for governmental finance statistics for macroeconomic analysis. Data are presented in the following framework: A. Total revenues and aid 1. Taxes and fees 2. Revenue on capital 3. Revenue on aids B. Total state expenditure Of which: 1. Regular expenditures 2. Expenditures on investment development C. State budget deficit: Deficit over GDP (%) D. Payment on principal These frameworks (quarterly and annually estimates) are published for international organizations and donors. 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  The article 5 of State Budget Law 2015 stipulating the state budget’s scope includes State budget revenue, State budget expenditure, state budget deficit and total state budget borrowing, including loans to offset deficit and loans for payment on principal of the state budget. Decree No. 163/2015/ND-CP contains the Article 2 to the Article 5 detail designates the state budget’s scope. Scope of state budget revenue Specifying fees to be paid to the state budget (as for taxes); For charges collected from service activities invested and implemented by the State will be submitted to the State budget (applied deduction) allowed to deduct from the public non-business units and SOEs, and the remainder will be submitted to the State budget; For revenues from lotery activities: 100% are inherited by the local budget simulteneously not used to determine the percentage (%) for the division of revenues and to determine the balance amounts. Scope of state budget expenditure: To stipulate expenditures on lotery revenues, government bonds to be included in the state budget expenditure. State budget deficit State budget deficits include central and local deficits. The central budget deficit is determined by the larger difference between the total central budget expenditures excluding payment on principal and total revenues of the central budget. The provincial level budget deficit is decided by the National Assembly, which is the sum of budget deficits at provincial levels. Regarding to the payment on principal of state budget loan: Payment on principal is not a balance of state budget expenditure, source of payment on loans for payment on principal of state budget, State Budget deficit, raising revenues and expenditure savings compared to estimates in the process of State budget execution, budget surplus (Articles 7, 59 and 72). Payment on principal is decided annually by the National Assembly and Provincial People's Council. As a result, State Budget Law 2015 sets out the budget scope that is more in line with international practice: expenditure on lottery and expenditure on investment from government bonds are included in the balance of budget rather stipulated in state budget law 2002. Thus,budget deficit is reflected properly and sufficiently from the source of government bonds. In addition, the elimination of principal payments from total expenditures has led to overspending of Vietnam’s state budget closer to the classification of international practices (GFSM1986). The provincial budget deficit is also reflected in the total state budget overspending, which reflects sufficiently and actually budget overspending according to international practices. Besides, State Budget Law also stipulating that non-budgetary funds must be reported together with the budget report to the National Assembly.  Unrecorded activity  Illegal activities 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  1. International publicity: Data sheets as stipulated in Decision No. 749/QD-BTC dated 7 March 2005 The subclass data which presented in quaterly and annually estimates is roughly in line with the Government Financial Management Manual GFSM1986), although it has not yet specificly classified in GFSM1986. Revenues are subclassed into taxes and fees (by core taxes), land use rights, house sales and non-refundable aids. Expenditures are subclassed to development investment, regular expenditures (including interest payment). 2. Domestic disclosure: State budget disclosure tables (applied from the budget year 2017) in accordance to the stipulation in Circular No. 343/2016/TT-BTC of December 30/ 2016, guiding the implementation of public budgets of the budgetary levels, include: The system of tables publicizing data on state budget estimates and allocating the central budget submitted to the National Assembly (11 tables). The system of tables publicizing data on state budget estimates and allocating central budget is decided by the National Assembly (11 tables). The system tables publicizing data on the implementation of quarterly state budget estimates (6 months, year) are reported to the Government (03 tables). The system of public data tables on state budget settlements are approved by the National Assembly (7 tables). Of which: revenues include domestic revenues, revenues from crude oil, balances from import-export activities, revenues from aid; Expenditures include development investment expenditures, regular expenditures, interest payments, aid, additional financial reserve funds; The budget overs pendings include central and local budget overspending; payment on principal; total amount of state budget borrowing. 2.4.1 Valuation  In all three sets of data transactions in foreign currency are converted at the MOF accounting exchange rate for the State Budget prevailing in that month or quarter. The MOF sets its monthly exchange rate based on the inter-bank exchange rate. Issues of Treasury Bills are recorded for the amount they were sold. Grants in-kind that are used directly by the recipient are valued by the MOF based on its market value. Grants in-kind that are auctioned upon proposal of donors. 2.4.2 Recording basis  Budget monitoring tables: For preliminary (monthly, quarterly, and annual) data, revenue and non-refunded grants in cash (including non-refunded grants in- kind sold for cash) are recorded when the cash is received. Non-refunded grants in-kind used directly by the recipient are recorded when the recipient gets the grants, which is the time the goods enter the country. Current expenditure that is made through transfers (when expenditure has been committed and all supporting documents have been submitted) and advances (when the supporting documents are not yet available) of the State Treasury to spending units are recorded when money is withdrawn form State Treasury account to pay suppliers of goods and services or expenditure via budgetary beneficial units (in case suppliers of goods and services are not directly paid by State Treasury). This timing need not coincide with the corresponding cash payments by the spending unit. Current expenditure that is administered through payment orders (like those of special programs) are recorded when these are made. Expenditure on interest and repayment of principal of debts are recorded on a cash basis. For loans that finance directly purchases of goods and services, the expenditure and the disbursement are recorded when the External Finance Department of the MOF is notified by the creditor of the disbursement (and not on the date the disbursement was made).This timing has usually one-month lag with respect to the date of actual disbursement. Final data are recorded on a cash basis. No adjustments are made for both preliminary and final data for the complementary period during which payments for authorized expenditures can be made. Tables reported to international organizations and donors: Same time of recording as for budget monitoring reports. On-lending transactions are recorded at the time of the disbursement of the foreign financing. Revenues retained by units are recorded when the cash is received. Data disseminated to the public: Revenue is recorded on a cash basis, when collections are made. Expenditure is recorded when a payment is made. Expenditure financed by direct disbursements from Official Development Assistance (ODA) are recorded when receiving capital withdrawing report from donor and SBD received supporting documents from Department of Debt Management and External Finance. Non-refunded grants in-kind for direct use by the recipient are recorded when the goods enter the country, non-refunded grants in-kind to be sold for cash are recorded when the cash is obtained. Audited Accounts: In all three sets of data the final annual figures correspond to the audited accounts. The State Budget Accounts are audited selectively by the State Audit Office.",

Methodology 2.1.1 Concepts and definitions  Annual data on all the units of the general government operations and of the extra-budgetary units are compiled and published in the Report of the Final Accounts. The Final Accounts present the operations of the central government in accordance with the budgetary classifications of revenues and expenditures, which up until 1999 were not prepared in accordance with the statistical framework set out in the IMF's ""Manual on Government Finance Statistics"", (GFS 1986). 2.2.1 Scope  Scope of the data  Transaction Coverage: Up to 1999, the General Government Budget included only the loan disbursements used to finance projects executed by the central government. Disbursements and the debt service of loans extended to finance projects of public enterprises were not included in the Budget or in the Final Accounts as loans but were treated as government equity participation in those public enterprises. In the Budget for 2000, all loans are covered, and those used to finance projects of public enterprises are recorded as lending from the central government to the public enterprises. Data on grants used to finance projects implemented directly by donors are not included in the government accounts. Unit Coverage: Annual and monthly data cover all units included in the General Government Budget. The units covered by the Budget are the following: ministries and the offices under their responsibility, the Presidency, the Consultancy Council, the Central Organization for Control and Auditing, the Parliament, Judiciary, electorate, the Cabinet, and the Central Intelligence Office. The provincial administrations (Governorates) are included in the Ministry of Local Administration. Since 2002 local authorities have their own approved budgets which are consolidated with those of the general government budget. The Final Accounts also include the operations of the extra-budgetary units, but their operations are not consolidated with those of the general government. Data reported to IMF's ""Government Finance Statistics Yearbook"" (""GFS"") cover only the units covered by the General Budget.  Unrecorded activity  See Unit Coverage and Transaction Coverage. 2.3.1 Classification/sectorization  In the Report of Final Accounts, the data are organized in accordance with the budgetary classification of revenues and expenditures, as follows: Total revenues are classified into the following broad categories: chapter (1) current revenue, which includes tax revenue (taxes, custom duties, royalties, etc.) and non-tax revenue (property income, rents, oil revenue, administrative fees, fines, etc.); chapter (2) capital revenue, which includes sales of assets and stocks; chapter (3) grants; chapter (4) reimbursement received on loans (income received from government lending and equity participation in public enterprises). The chapters are divided into sub-chapters, items and sub-items. Total expenditures are classified into the following broad categories: chapter (1) current expenditures, which include wages and salaries, goods and services, maintenance, current transfers, interest payments, and unclassified expenditure; chapter (2) capital investment expenditures; chapter (3) lending to and equity participation in the public enterprises; chapter (4) loan repayments. The chapters are divided into sub-chapters and sub-items. Until 1999, in the final accounts the deficit was defined as total revenue minus total expenditure. A new classification system for revenue and expenditure, that follows the framework set out in the IMF's ""Manual on Government Finance Statistics"" (1968) has been introduced in the Budget for the year 2000. 2.4.1 Valuation  Revenues in foreign exchange and disbursements of foreign loans are converted into units of national currency using the buying rates of the day. Expenditures are converted using the selling rates of the day.  2.4.2 Recording basis  The operations of the central government are recorded on a cash basis. Revenues are recorded when they are received by governmental unit cashier or deposited at governmental account in local bank. Expenditures are recorded when checks are issued, and exclude checks unpaid at the end of the year. In the Central Government accounts compiled by the Central Bank of Yemen the revenues are recorded when they are received by the bank, expenditures are recorded when checks are paid.",
