SPI.DIM1.5.INDEX,Dimension 1.5: Data use by international organizations,"Five measures usefulness or reliability of country produced measures for international organizations. First, on comparability of poverty estimates for the World Bank reporting on international poverty (Source: Povcalnet). Second on usable surveys for statistics on child mortality for the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (Source: https://childmortality.org/). Third on accuracy of debt reporting as classified by the World Bank (Source: World Bank WDI metadata).  Fourth, on availability of safely managed drinking water data for use by JMP.  Fifth, on labor force participation data for use by ILO. We recognize that these data sources provide only partial coverage but consider that they do at least provide some indication of the performance of the national statistical system. With more complete data sources it would be possible to assess this further"
SPI.DIM2.1.INDEX,Dimension 2.1: Data Releases,"SDDS/e-GDDS subscription. This indicator is based on whether the country subscribes to IMF SDDS+, SDDS, or e-GDDS standards.  The source is the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.  This is a good data source but we recognize that it is a proxy for the concept we are seeking to capture rather than a direct measurement."
SPI.DIM2.2.INDEX,Dimension 2.2: Online access,"ODIN Open Data Openness score.  This is a well-established data source with good country coverage. In using this indicator, it is important to describe carefully what is captured since the purpose of ODIN is different to the purpose of the SPI."
SPI.DIM2.4.INDEX,Dimension 2.4: Data services,"NADA metadata.  This indicator checks whether NADA microdata cataloging is available for surveys produced by NSO.  NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Cores RDF metadata standards.  Source: NSO websites."
SPI.DIM3.1.INDEX,Dimension 3.1: Social Statistics,"Average score for Goal 1-6 indicators. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. Whilst this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, it is clear that many (particularly developed countries) are not yet submitting their available national data. Scores for these countries are likely to represent an indicator of their willingness to submit national data rather than their performance in calculating the indicators.  For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand (https://www.oecd.org/sdd/measuring-distance-to-the-sdg-targets-2019-a8caf3fa-en.htm)."
SPI.DIM3.2.INDEX,Dimension 3.2: Economic Statistics,Average score for Goal 7-12 indicators. See 3.1.
SPI.DIM3.3.INDEX,Dimension 3.3: Environmental Statistics,Average score for Goal 13-15 indicators. See 3.1.
SPI.DIM3.4.INDEX,Dimension 3.4: Institutional Statistics,Average score for Goal 16-17 indicators. See 3.1.
SPI.DIM4.1.CEN.INDEX,Dimension 4.1: Censuses and Surveys - Censuses only,"Average score Census and Survey Indicators indicators. Availability of recent censuses and surveys covering broad areas.  The following censuses and surveys are considered: Population & Housing census, Agriculture census, Business/establishment census, Household Survey on income/ consumption/ expenditure/ budget/ Integrated Survey, Agriculture survey, Labor Force Survey, Health/Demographic survey, Business/establishment survey. Source: NSO websites, World Bank microdata library, ILO microdata library, IHSN microdata librar"
SPI.DIM4.1.SVY.INDEX,Dimension 4.1: Censuses and Surveys - Surveys only,"Average score Census and Survey Indicators indicators. Availability of recent censuses and surveys covering broad areas.  The following censuses and surveys are considered: Population & Housing census, Agriculture census, Business/establishment census, Household Survey on income/ consumption/ expenditure/ budget/ Integrated Survey, Agriculture survey, Labor Force Survey, Health/Demographic survey, Business/establishment survey. Source: NSO websites, World Bank microdata library, ILO microdata library, IHSN microdata librar"
SPI.DIM4.2.INDEX,Dimension 4.2: Administrative Data,"Average score for CRVS indicator.  An ideal indicator would include a score based on the density of administrative data available in sectors of social protection, education, labor, and health.  However, social protection, education, health, and labor admin data indicators not included because of lack of established methodology. While our team identified several promising sources for administrative data from the World Bank's ASPIRE team, WHO, UNESCO, and ILO, incomplete coverage across countries made us drop these indicators from our index.  A major research and data collection effort is needed from all custodian agencies  to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of administrative data availability can be produced."
SPI.DIM4.3.INDEX,Dimension 4.3: Geospatial Data,"Geospatial data available at 1st Admin Level.  We recognize that this data source provides only limited coverage but consider that it does at least provide some indication of the ability of the national statistical system to produce geospatial data. A major research and data collection effort is needed via GGIM to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of geospatial data capability at the national level can be produced. Until this is done, it we cannot even assess the scale of the data gaps in a comparable way."
SPI.DIM5.1.INDEX,Dimension 5.1: Legislation and governance,"Included in dashboard, but not index because of insufficient country coverage.  This indicator is based on PARIS21 indicators on SDG 17.18.2 (national statistical legislation compliance with UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics), existence of National Statistical Council, national statistical strategy generation, national statistical plan. Limited country coverage makes cross country comparison limited.  A global database of statistical and data legislation and governance practice would be a valuable resource for capacity building in general not just for the SPI."
SPI.DIM5.2.INDEX,Dimension 5.2: Standards and Methods,"Average score for Standards and Methods indicators. Internationally accepted and recommended methodology, classifications and standards provide the basis for national statistical offices (NSOs) on data integration, facilitating data exchange and providing the foundation for the preparation of relevant statistical indicators.  The following methods and standards are considered:  System of national accounts in use, National Accounts base year, Classification of national industry, CPI base year, Classification of household consumption, Classification of status of employment, Central government accounting status, Compilation of government finance statistics, Compilation of monetary and financial statistics, Business process.  . Further work could improve the validity of this indicator and reduce the risk that countries may be incentivized to adopt only traditional standards and methods and neglect innovative solutions that may be more valid in the current context."
SPI.DIM5.5.INDEX,Dimension 5.5: Finance,"Included in dashboard, but not index because of insufficient country coverage and concerns that the indicator has biases that would lead to misleading incentives.  The indicator is based on PARIS21 SDG indicators (SDG 17.18.3 (national statistical plan that is fully funded and under implementation)."
