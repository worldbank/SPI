1. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on Argentina to adopt measures to address the quality of official GDP and consumer price index data, and issued an updated statement on Argentina’s progress on August 31, 2016: http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/08/31/PR16389-Statement-by-the-IMF-Executive-Board-on-Argentina. 

2. The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions. Based on this information an alternative conversion factor has been calculated using a weighted average method for this period.","Latin America & Caribbean","Upper middle income","AR","2004",NA,"Value added at basic prices (VAB)","IBRD",NA,"Country uses the 2008 System of National Accounts methodology.","1971–84; 2012-15",NA,"IMF Balance of Payments Manual, 6th edition.",NA,"Special trade system","Consolidated central government","Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)","2010","Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2011/12","Integrated household survey (IHS), 2013","Yes","2008",2002,2014,2011,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions. Based on this information an alternative conversion factor has been calculated using a weighted average method for this period.","Latin America & Caribbean","Upper middle income","AR","2004",NA,"Value added at basic prices (VAB)","IBRD",NA,"Country uses the 2008 System of National Accounts methodology.","1971–84; 2012-15",NA,"IMF Balance of Payments Manual, 6th edition.","Actual","Special trade system","Consolidated central government","Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)","2010","Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2011/12","Integrated household survey (IHS), 2014","Yes","2008",2002,2015,2011,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions. Based on this information an alternative conversion factor has been calculated using a weighted average method for this period.","Latin America & Caribbean","High income","AR","2004",NA,"Value added at basic prices (VAB)","IBRD",NA,"Country uses the 2008 System of National Accounts methodology","1971–84; 2012-15",NA,"BPM6","Actual","Special trade system","Consolidated central government","Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)","2010","Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2011/12","Integrated household survey (IHS), 2016","Yes","2008",2002,2017,NA,2018,NA,NA,NA,NA

Countries are distinguished based on the nature and severity of issues they face. The classification uses the following categories:
- Countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on publicly available indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions and manifestations of fragility.
- Countries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related deaths relative to the population. This category includes two sub-categories based on the intensity of violence: countries in high-intensity conflict and countries in medium-intensity conflict.

Countries are distinguished based on the nature and severity of issues they face. The classification uses the following categories:
- Countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on publicly available indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions and manifestations of fragility.
- Countries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related deaths relative to the population. This category includes two sub-categories based on the intensity of violence: countries in high-intensity conflict and countries in medium-intensity conflict.

Where available, data for each country are shown separately. However, for Serbia, some indicators, such as those series for which data appear only for Serbia and not Montenegro--e.g., aid, environment, external debt, balance of payments, various social indicators excluding population--continue to include data for Montenegro through 2005. Moreover, data from 1999 onward for Serbia for most indicators exclude data for Kosovo, 1999 being the year when Kosovo became a territory under international administration pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999); any exceptions are noted. Kosovo became a World Bank member on June 29, 2009; available data are shown separately for Kosovo. In 2011, the Statistical Office of Serbia improved the methodology of national accounts data for 2003 onward.

Countries are distinguished based on the nature and severity of issues they face. The classification uses the following categories:

- Countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on publicly available indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions and manifestations of fragility.
- Countries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related deaths relative to the population. This category includes two sub-categories based on the intensity of violence: countries in high-intensity conflict and countries in medium-intensity conflict.
