SPI.INDEX,SPI Overall Score,"The SPI overall score is a composite score measuing country performance across five pillars: data use, data services, data products, data sources, and data infrastructure.  The new Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) will replace the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI), which the World Bank has regularly published since 2004. Although the goals are the same, to offer a better tool to measure the statistical systems of countries, the new SPI framework has expanded into new areas including in the areas of data use, administrative data, geospatial data, data services, and data infrastructure. The SPI provides a framework that can help countries measure where they stand in several dimensions and offers an ambitious measurement agenda for the international community.",Weighted average of all statistical performance indicators.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.
SPI.INDEX.PIL1,Pillar 1  - Data Use - Score,"The data use overall score is a composite score measuring the demand side of the statistical system.  The data use  pillar is segmented by five types of users: (i) the legislature, (ii) the executive branch, (iii) civil society (including sub-national actors), (iv) academia and (v) international bodies.  Each dimension would have associated indicators to measure performance. A mature system would score well across all dimensions whereas a less mature one would have weaker scores along certain dimensions. The gaps would give insights into prioritization among user groups and help answer questions as to why the existing services are not resulting in higher use of national statistics in a particular segment.  Currently, the SPI only features indicators for one of the five dimensions of data use, which is data use by international organizations. Indicators on whether statistical systems are providing useful data to their national governments (legislature and executive branches), to civil society, and to academia are absent.  Thus the dashboard does not yet assess if national statistical systems are meeting the data needs of a large swathe of users. ",Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data use.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.
SPI.INDEX.PIL2,Pillar 2 - Data Services - Score,"The data services pillar overall score is a composite indicator based on four dimensions of data services: (i) the quality of data releases, (ii) the richness and openness of online access, (iii) the effectiveness of advisory and analytical services related to statistics, and (iv) the availability and use of data access services such as secure microdata access. Advisory and analytical services might incorporate elements related to data stewardship services including input to national data strategies, advice on data ethics and calling out misuse of data in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.",Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data services.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.
SPI.INDEX.PIL3,Pillar 3 - Data Products - Score,"The data products overall score is a composite score measureing whether the country is able to produce relevant indicators, primarily related to SDGs.  The data products (internal process) pillar is segmented by four topics and organized into (i) social, (ii) economic, (iii) environmental, and (iv) institutional dimensions using the typology of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This approach anchors the national statistical system’s performance around the essential data required to support the achievement of the 2030 global goals, and enables comparisons across countries so that a global view can be generated while enabling country specific emphasis to reflect the user needs of that country.",Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data products.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.
SPI.INDEX.PIL4,Pillar 4 - Data Sources - Score,"The data sources overall score is a composity measure of whether countries have data available from the following sources: Censuses and surveys, administrative data, geospatial data, and private sector/citizen generated data.  The data sources (input) pillar is segmented by four types of sources generated by (i) the statistical office (censuses and surveys), and sources accessed from elsewhere such as (ii)  administrative data, (iii) geospatial data, and (iv) private sector data and citizen generated data. The appropriate balance between these source types will vary depending on a country’s institutional setting and the maturity of its statistical system. High scores should reflect the extent to which the sources being utilized enable the necessary statistical indicators to be generated. For example, a low score on environment statistics (in the data production pillar) may reflect a lack of use of (and low score for) geospatial data (in the data sources pillar). This type of linkage is inherent in the data cycle approach and can help highlight areas for investment required if country needs are to be met.",Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data sources.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.
SPI.INDEX.PIL5,Pillar 5 - Data Infrastructure - Score,"The data infrastructure  pillar  overall score measures the hard and soft infrastructure segments, itemizing essential cross cutting requirements for an effective statistical system.  The segments are: (i) legislation and governance covering the existence of laws and a functioning institutional framework for the statistical system; (ii) standards and methods addressing compliance with recognized frameworks and concepts; (iii) skills including level of skills within the statistical system and among users (statistical literacy); (iv) partnerships reflecting the need for the statistical system to be inclusive and coherent; and (v) finance mobilized both domestically and from donors.",Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data infrastructure.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.
SPI.DIM1.5.INDEX,Dimension 1.5: Data use by international organizations,"Five measures usefulness or reliability of country produced measures for international organizations. First, on comparability of poverty estimates for the World Bank reporting on international poverty (Source: Povcalnet). Second on usable surveys for statistics on child mortality for the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (Source: https://childmortality.org/). Third on accuracy of debt reporting as classified by the World Bank (Source: World Bank WDI metadata).  Fourth, on availability of safely managed drinking water data for use by JMP.  Fifth, on labor force participation data for use by ILO. We recognize that these data sources provide only partial coverage but consider that they do at least provide some indication of the performance of the national statistical system. With more complete data sources it would be possible to assess this further","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM2.1.INDEX,Dimension 2.1: Data Releases,"SDDS/e-GDDS subscription. This indicator is based on whether the country subscribes to IMF SDDS+, SDDS, or e-GDDS standards.  The source is the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.  This is a good data source but we recognize that it is a proxy for the concept we are seeking to capture rather than a direct measurement.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM2.2.INDEX,Dimension 2.2: Online access,"ODIN Open Data Openness score.  This is a well-established data source with good country coverage. In using this indicator, it is important to describe carefully what is captured since the purpose of ODIN is different to the purpose of the SPI.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM2.4.INDEX,Dimension 2.4: Data services,"NADA metadata.  This indicator checks whether NADA microdata cataloging is available for surveys produced by NSO.  NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Cores RDF metadata standards.

SPI.DIM3.1.INDEX,Dimension 3.1: Social Statistics,"Average score for Goal 1-6 indicators. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. Whilst this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, it is clear that many (particularly developed countries) are not yet submitting their available national data. Scores for these countries are likely to represent an indicator of their willingness to submit national data rather than their performance in calculating the indicators.  For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand (https://www.oecd.org/sdd/measuring-distance-to-the-sdg-targets-2019-a8caf3fa-en.htm).","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.

SPI.DIM4.2.INDEX,Dimension 4.2: Administrative Data,"Average score for CRVS indicator.  An ideal indicator would include a score based on the density of administrative data available in sectors of social protection, education, labor, and health.  However, social protection, education, health, and labor admin data indicators not included because of lack of established methodology. While our team identified several promising sources for administrative data from the World Bank's ASPIRE team, WHO, UNESCO, and ILO, incomplete coverage across countries made us drop these indicators from our index.  A major research and data collection effort is needed from all custodian agencies  to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of administrative data availability can be produced.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM4.3.INDEX,Dimension 4.3: Geospatial Data,"Geospatial data available at 1st Admin Level.  We recognize that this data source provides only limited coverage but consider that it does at least provide some indication of the ability of the national statistical system to produce geospatial data. A major research and data collection effort is needed via GGIM to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of geospatial data capability at the national level can be produced. Until this is done, it we cannot even assess the scale of the data gaps in a comparable way.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM5.1.INDEX,Dimension 5.1: Legislation and governance,"Included in dashboard, but not index because of insufficient country coverage.  This indicator is based on PARIS21 indicators on SDG 17.18.2 (national statistical legislation compliance with UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics), existence of National Statistical Council, national statistical strategy generation, national statistical plan. Limited country coverage makes cross country comparison limited.  A global database of statistical and data legislation and governance practice would be a valuable resource for capacity building in general not just for the SPI.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM5.2.INDEX,Dimension 5.2: Standards and Methods,"Average score for Standards and Methods indicators. Internationally accepted and recommended methodology, classifications and standards provide the basis for national statistical offices (NSOs) on data integration, facilitating data exchange and providing the foundation for the preparation of relevant statistical indicators.  The following methods and standards are considered:  System of national accounts in use, National Accounts base year, Classification of national industry, CPI base year, Classification of household consumption, Classification of status of employment, Central government accounting status, Compilation of government finance statistics, Compilation of monetary and financial statistics, Business process.  . Further work could improve the validity of this indicator and reduce the risk that countries may be incentivized to adopt only traditional standards and methods and neglect innovative solutions that may be more valid in the current context.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM5.5.INDEX,Dimension 5.5: Finance,"Included in dashboard, but not index because of insufficient country coverage and concerns that the indicator has biases that would lead to misleading incentives.
